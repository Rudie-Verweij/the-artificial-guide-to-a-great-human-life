The research referenced throughout this guide. If something caught your attention, these are the people and works worth exploring further.

**Goal-Setting & Planning**

- Edwin Locke & Gary Latham — *Goal-Setting Theory* (1990, 2002). The foundational work on how goals direct attention and energise effort.
- Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky — *Planning Fallacy* (1979). Why we systematically underestimate the time and cost required for nearly everything.
- Bent Flyvbjerg — Megaproject research. Analysis of 16,000+ large projects showing 91.5% go over budget, over schedule, or both.
- Roger Buehler — Research on prediction accuracy. We're better at estimating how long things will take others than ourselves.
- Richard Wiseman — Study of 3,000 participants (2007). Found 88% of resolution-setters fail despite initial confidence.
- John Norcross — University of Scranton study on New Year's resolutions. 77% maintained for one week, only 19% after two years.

**Wellbeing & Motivation**

- Tim Kasser & Richard Ryan — *Goal Contents Theory*. Pursuit of extrinsic goals (wealth, fame, image) predicts worse psychological health.
- Dittmar, Bond, Hurst & Kasser — Meta-analysis linking materialism to lower life satisfaction and negative self-image.
- Kennon Sheldon & Lawrence Krieger — Study of 6,200 lawyers. Income, class rank, and partnership status had near-zero correlation with wellbeing.
- Jennifer Crocker — Research on contingent self-worth. Identity fused with outcomes creates addictive highs and destructive lows.
- Kent Berridge — University of Michigan neuroscience research. Proved dopamine drives *wanting*, not *liking* — roughly 90% of the nucleus accumbens generates desire without pleasure.

**Learning & Achievement**

- Maurizio Zollo — *Superstitious Learning*. Success without analysis produces confident but incorrect beliefs about what works.
- Shmuel Ellis — Research on success review. Identifying what almost went wrong is the most effective element of learning from wins.

**Identity & Narrative**

- Dan McAdams — Decades of research on narrative identity. Your identity is your internalised, evolving life story. Redemption narratives predict higher wellbeing and generativity.
- Jonathan Adler — Study of 47 adults tracking 600 personal narratives through psychotherapy. Stories changed *before* psychological wellbeing improved.
- Dunlop & Tracy — Study of recovering alcoholics. Those whose last-drink stories contained redemption sequences stayed sober at 83% vs. 44%.
- Mary H. Jacobsen — *Hand-me-down Dreams*. On inherited family values that conflict with personal direction.

**Philosophical Traditions**

- Stoicism — *Premeditatio malorum*: mentally rehearsing loss before it arrives.
- Buddhism — The distinction between *taṇhā* (compulsive craving) and *chanda* (wholesome aspiration).
- Taoism — The Taoist farmer parable on the impermanence of fortune.
- Kishōtenketsu — East Asian narrative structure from Chinese Tang Dynasty poetry. Four movements: introduction, development, twist, reconciliation.
