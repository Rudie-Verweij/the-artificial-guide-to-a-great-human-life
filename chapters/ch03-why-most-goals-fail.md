## Chapter Three: Why Most Goals Fail

For many, there is a massive divide between what they say and what they do; this often stems from two factors: the underestimation of effort required and the misalignment with what we actually desire.

Most of us have honest intentions, but our day starts, and we become unconscious. Sometimes we black out for months just to find ourselves staring into a lake on a random Sunday afternoon, remembering all our good intentions from the start of the year. In this hyper-stimulating world, it is easy to lose track of time; without mindfulness, a new way of being can not be implemented.

For the more conscious, the problem often lies in a lack of a deeper understanding of oneself. We may strive for money with the hidden goal to feel secure or become a successful manager to feel important. Often we are ashamed of the underlying feeling and cover it with complex stories of wants and needs, hopes and dreams. This is not necessarily a problem if it serves you well, unfortunately, for many of us, it manifests as a toxic slurry that drags us into a dark place. Often, when the goals are reached, a further feeling of despair consumes us, realising that it did not solve our internal problems, and we are left disillusioned with life.

When reading, I ask only that you resist the urge to separate yourself from the 8,300,000,000 other humans. We are all liable to fall for these two tricks of the mind.


### What is the Goal of Goals?

It is believed that the Babylonians made the first New Year's resolutions about 4000 years ago at the start of their spring barley harvest. Fast forward to today, and millions of people set New Year's resolutions every year. According to the Goal-Setting Theory, a study by Locke & Latham (1990, 2002), goals can direct attention, energise effort and increase persistence. This helps achieve the desired outcome of the goal.


### "Quitter's Day"

Unfortunately, most goals are quickly abandoned, the most famous being the lofty New Year's Eve resolutions. In 2019, Strava analysed over 800 million user-logged activities and found that New Year's resolutions typically last until January 19th (cleverly coined "Quitters Day"). The numbers get worse: John Norcross and colleagues at the University of Scranton found that 77% of New Year's resolutions are maintained for one week, and only 19% are still being pursued two years later. Finally, Richard Wiseman's 2007 study of 3,000 participants found that 88% of those who set resolutions fail to achieve them, despite 52% being confident of success when they started. Outside of New Year's resolutions that often focus on habit changes, we often set specific goals throughout the year. This can be related to financial achievements, such as a savings goal or external validations, such as social media metrics. No matter the type of goal, they all seem to be plagued by an underestimation of effort.


### Planning Fallacy

And it's not a matter of intelligence, some of the smartest people in the world entrusted with billions are falling for the same underestimation of timelines. The term "Planning Fallacy" was introduced by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979 in their paper "Intuitive Prediction: Biases and Corrective Procedures." They realised that we tend to underestimate the time required to complete a goal, even when we have past experiences of failure. In other words, we not only underestimate the needed time, but also do not learn from those mistakes! Roger Buehler's studies reveal further critical insights, such as the fact that we more accurately predict the required time when planning for others compared to ourselves. The reasoning for this is complex but centres around the following points:

Memory Biases: We misremember how long tasks took in the past.
Planning Simulations: When we think of the future, we often can only simulate a perfect world without setbacks.
Uniqueness Bias: Bent Flyvbjerg's megaproject research identified the tendency to see one's own goals as unique.

Bent Flyvbjerg illustrates these 3 points brilliantly by analysing over 16,000 large projects and found 91.5% go over budget, over schedule, or both. Fewer than 1% are completed on time, on budget, and deliver promised benefits.

Further examples of mega projects failing to achieve their goals:

Sydney Opera House: Estimated $7 million completion; actual $102 million.
Channel Tunnel: Predicted £4.9 billion; actual £10+ billion.
Denver International Airport: 200% cost overrun.


### Play silly games, win silly prizes

Now, some would argue that being overly optimistic is a good thing, as it can get us started in the right direction, but unfortunately, setting shitty goals has shitty consequences. Research by Kasser and Ryan found that people who strongly valued financial success reported worse psychological health. The pattern holds: a meta-analysis by Dittmar, Bond, Hurst, and Kasser confirmed that materialism is connected with lower life satisfaction, risky health behaviours, and negative self-image.

Even if the timeline is correctly estimated, sticking with the wrong goals is challenging and can be dangerous. "Goal Contents Theory" describes the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic goals. Intrinsic goals include personal growth, meaningful relationships, community involvement, and physical health. Extrinsic goals include financial success, fame, and image/appearance.

Knowing the negatives of extrinsic goals, why are we so often drawn to them? A meta-analysis by Tobin et al. found that being exposed to social media content showing a higher social status negatively affects the users' well-being and contributes to further feelings of depression. Social media users consistently set more extrinsic goals. This comparison also holds up in the real world, where being exposed to what others may have can increase your desire to "keep up with the Joneses", an American saying describing the need to keep up with the neighbours when they buy a new car or go on a luxury holiday. The fundamental problem with extrinsic goals is that they fail to satisfy the psychological needs they are unconsciously meant to address:

Surface Goal: Wealth → Underlying Need: Security.
Surface Goal: Fame → Underlying Need: Recognition that one matters.
Surface Goal: The Perfect Image → Underlying Need: Self-acceptance.
Surface Goal: Status Symbols → Underlying Need: Being recognised as a competent person.


### The rat race offers no cheese at the finish line

Another danger is the "Arrival Fallacy," which makes many believe that achieving a specific goal will bring lasting happiness. The consequences of relying on the "Arrival Fallacy" are well exemplified in post-Olympic depression. Olympic superstars are often depicted as the very definition of drive and determination. In the meantime, a large portion of them suffer from major mental difficulties right after their big victory. They are often operating in a constant state of desire to motivate their relentless action. When their desire is seemingly fulfilled, it can have devastating effects.


### Effortless Goals

In response to these and other challenges, I propose the concept of Effortless Goals. A method to help set more sustainable goals that improve one's well-being. People often say, "You can do anything you set your mind to". This is, in my humble opinion, total bullshit. That is why Effortless Goals are designed to cut the crap and try to be as close to reality as possible. Think of it as harm reduction for goal-setting: clean needles and proper dosing will help reduce casualties, but do not necessarily solve the underlying problems. The deeper work comes in later chapters.

The method has five steps. Each one acts as a filter, the goals that make it through all five are likely worth pursuing. Goals that don't should probably be abandoned.


**Step 1: Surface Goal**

Start by writing down what you think you want. Don't edit yourself yet, just capture the goal as it naturally appears in your mind.

Examples:
"I want to make $1 million"
"I want to be a successful entrepreneur"
"I want to be promoted to director"
"I want to start a podcast"

This is your surface goal, the thing you'd tell someone at a party if they asked about your ambitions.


**Step 2: Radical Self Honesty**

For most, this is one of the hardest steps, as digging deep into the subconscious takes time and energy. Ask "why do I want this?" and keep drilling down until the answer feels uncomfortably honest. For example, "I want financial security" can be a safe version of "I want to stop feeling anxious that I'm one mistake away from losing everything".

Further examples:
"I want to be promoted" may mask → "I want respect" or "I want to prove my worth"
"I want to get fit" may mask → "I want to feel attractive" or "I want control over my life"
"I want to start a business" may mask → "I want autonomy" or "I want to prove I'm capable"

You can drill down to your core desire by continuously asking why, as if you are trying to understand somebody else's point of view:

"I want to start a podcast" Why? → "To share my ideas" Why? → "Because I have insights people should hear" Why? → "Because I want recognition for my thinking" Why? → "Because I want to feel like I matter and my ideas are respected"

Keep going until the answer feels vulnerable or slightly embarrassing. True desires almost always fall into one of these categories:

Security (safety, stability, freedom from fear or anxiety)
Acceptance (belonging, being valued, mattering to others, love)
Autonomy (control, freedom, self-determination, independence)
Competence (feeling capable, respected for skills, mastery, being "enough")

Important: Please be kind to yourself! These are difficult topics, and you may not like what you find. Have patience and realise that we are all human. This step is not about shaming, it's about removing the weight of being dishonest to yourself so that you can start moving towards a better future.


**Step 3: Create a Goal That Serves Your Desire**

Now that you know your underlying desire, you need to translate it into a concrete and actionable goal.

For example: Your desire is "I want to feel that I am heard and my ideas are respected"

Possible goals:
"Publish 10 well-researched articles in my field"
"Speak at 3 industry conferences"
"Host monthly dinners with 5 thoughtful people in my industry"

Your goal should be specific enough that you can estimate how long it will take, know when you've achieved it, and identify a strategy to get there.


**Step 4: Minimize**

Once you've created your goal, ask: "What's the smallest version of this goal that would still satisfy my desire?" Choose the version that's fastest, most direct, and most aligned with your actual life situation. Don't pick "write a best-selling book" if "become an expert in my community" would satisfy the same desire. Remember that the only thing that matters is how you feel about your situation. Identify the best bang for your buck.

The discipline is found in making the goal smaller and learning how to squeeze the maximum out of it. If you don't, then step 5 will destroy your hopes and dreams. Furthermore, you need to make sure it can be achieved with one single strategy. If your goal requires multiple different strategies, then in my opinion, it's a vision, not a goal. Large visions masquerading as goals force too many strategy changes along the way.

Example goals:
From €1,000/month to €10,000/month = one strategy.
From €10,000/month to €100,000/month = different strategy.
From €100,000/month to €1,000,000/month = radically different strategy.
Each strategy shift is essentially a new goal.


**Step 5: The Reality Multiplier**

Now take your reframed, minimized, single-strategy goal and estimate the total effort required. Consider how many hours per week you'll dedicate to this and how many weeks/months/years it will take.

Express this as a time estimation:
"2 hours/week for 6 months" (50 hours)
"10 hours/week for 1 year" (520 hours)
"40 hours/week for 2 years" (4,000 hours)

Account for difficulty! If something is completely new to you or requires intense focus, the same clock hours cost more psychological effort, and you will not be able to do as many per week.

Now comes the really shitty part. Multiply your total effort estimate by 10. Yes, 10x. I know... fuck that. But unfortunately, this is your realistic baseline, not worst case, not pessimistic. This is what you should actually expect.

Now ask yourself: If this goal takes 10x more effort than I thought, do I still want it? The results are often devastating, that "6-month side project" (50 hours) now becomes a 2-3 year endeavour (500 hours).

If 10x kills all your motivation, there may be one of these problems:
Problem #1: The desire isn't strong enough. Solution: Return to Step 2.
Problem #2: Your time commitment is too low. Solution: Adjust your time allocation if possible.
Problem #3: You didn't minimize properly. Solution: Return to Step 4.

Before abandoning a goal, see if you can increase your weekly time commitment. For example, you estimate that learning Spanish takes 3 months at 4 hours a week; this results in a 2.5-year estimate after applying the Multiplier. Alternatively, you envision 8 hours a week and 1.5 months of work, which would result in a roughly 1 year commitment.

Increasing weekly time only works if the goal actually responds to more hours; some things have natural pacing limits. On the flipside, some goals benefit greatly from extra weekly hours, exponentially speeding up completion time. Either way, ramp up slowly. Even a goal that survived all five filters can crush you if you throw yourself at it full speed from day one. Start at a pace that feels almost too easy, and build from there. Sustainable effort beats heroic sprints. If you can't increase weekly commitment, or if even maximum commitment yields a timeline that kills motivation, then the desire most likely isn't strong enough, or you failed to apply the minimisation techniques in the previous steps.

Consider two versions of the same type of goal:

Minimized: Building a small business in 6 months turns into 5 years.
Overly Ambitious: Building a large business in 2 years turns into 20 years.

The difference between 6 months and 2 years seems modest. But after the multiplier, it becomes the difference between a large chapter and the remainder of your career. Small reductions in goal size create massive reductions in required timeline.

If 10x feels trivially easy, your original estimate was probably a fantasy. Revisit your timeline with more honesty before applying the multiplier. On rare occasions, goals take significantly less effort than even your original estimate. You vastly underestimated your existing capabilities, or the goal was simpler than you thought; luck plays the biggest role in the early completion of goals. If this happens, great. The Reality Multiplier protects you from the far more common scenario: massive underestimation.

If your goal comes out of the 5 steps successfully, then to you I say "Happy Hunting".
