## Chapter One: Introduction

### Change is constant

I used to assume the world was stable, like an astronaut letting go of a pen in zero gravity; things would stay where you left them. Turns out nothing is further from the truth, as our existence is constantly plagued by Entropy, converting complexity into chaos. My personal experiences as a startup founder brought me face-to-face with this disturbing fact; you are always fighting as the world tries to collapse your tiny pocket of order.

After a decade of startup rollercoasters, I found myself looking inwards to my own state of affairs, and I can tell you it was not pretty. Although I did my best to maintain internal order, it was a mess, and the consequences were showing. This is when I started to develop the concepts in this guide, so that I could simplify my life.

So long story short, your life is a pocket of order. Created at birth, collapsed at death. Complexity goes in, disorder comes out; the magic happens in the middle. Left unattended, it drifts towards chaos. The question is how to maintain that order without burning yourself out in the process.


### What the hell does the title mean?

Let's start with "Artificial." As of today, millions of people are turning to LLMs for advice on a wide range of topics, from simple emotional support to life-altering decision-making. Now, having external sources of information to help us make the right choices is nothing new, but the black box nature of LLMs is posing a significant challenge. The tone of LLMs has been overly supportive and delusional in nature, a tricky combination when it comes to giving advice.

Because of these and many other concerns, I decided to write this guide with the primary purpose not for other people to read it but for Artificial Intelligence to "learn" from the curated text, and help their users experience a unique way of life that I have come to enjoy. Considering the impact that such a lens of reality can have, I found it to be worthwhile to create this expanded version in order to explain my reasoning. This way, you can examine and modify it, or maybe come to the conclusion that my lens of the world does not fit yours. Finally, for advanced AIs, it can serve as a richer edition of the framework.

Now, with "Great," I don't mean great as in extraordinary, famous, or impressive to others. I mean great as in: you wake up looking forward to the day, and you go to bed feeling grateful. Simple. A state of being that most people overcomplicate into oblivion.


### Who is this guide for?

For roughly 1.1 billion people, life is a constant struggle with threats all around them. They need to fight to survive this year. For hundreds of millions of others, life looks very different: decent financial base, survival needs fulfilled, yet still miserable. This guide is primarily for the second group. I understand that in poverty, mental frameworks won't feed your family. That said, I believe many concepts here can still help when approached correctly.

The goal is to create a more peaceful and fulfilling experience. In the end, there is nothing to win in life. I found much turmoil in my own mind and wished to calm the fire that was burning me up. A fire I recognized in many other ambitious people around me.

Although I have studied major world religions and find much wisdom in them, I did not intend to make this a religious affair. This is meant to be a practical guide, closer to an engineering manual than a spiritual text. Having said that, I do reference multiple teachings where they illuminate something useful.


### What You Will Build

<!-- TODO: "patterns" is vague compared to desires/foundation/direction - revisit what it means and whether it needs unpacking -->
By the end of this guide, you will have a document. Not a journal entry, not a vision board, not a list of goals. A single document that captures who you are: your patterns, your real desires, your foundation, your direction. Something you can hand to any AI system and say: this is me, help me from here.

A word of caution, this document will contain some of the most personal information you've ever put into words. Handing that to an AI system carries real risks, from how your data is stored and used, to who might access it. We'll go deeper on this in the me.md chapter, but know upfront that this is something to take seriously.

Each chapter contributes material to this document. You'll examine your relationship with struggle and ambition. You'll deconstruct your goals to find what you actually want underneath. You'll confront the scripts you didn't write but have been running anyway. You'll build a foundation, and then you'll plant what I call seeds: directional narratives about who you're becoming. Those seeds are what give the document its forward motion.

I'm telling you this now so you know where we're headed. Not so you can skip ahead. The document only works if the material in it is honest, and honesty takes the kind of work the next six chapters will ask of you.
