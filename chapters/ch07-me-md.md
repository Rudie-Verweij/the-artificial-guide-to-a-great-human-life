## Chapter Seven: me.md

### Why Create a me.md File?

Before we start creating your own version of "ME" I want you to think about what happens when you open a conversation with an AI system. You type a question. The AI responds based on statistical patterns drawn from billions of words. It sounds articulate. It sounds thoughtful. It sounds like it knows you. It doesn't.


Without context, AI gives you the same generic advice it would give anyone. "Have you considered journaling?" "It might help to talk to a therapist." "Remember to practice self-care." These aren't wrong, exactly. They're just useless. It's like asking a doctor for help without telling them where it hurts.

The previous six chapters did something specific. They walked you through a process of understanding yourself with a depth that most people never attempt. All of that work lives in your head right now. Maybe in some scattered notes. Me.md takes everything you've uncovered and puts it in one place. One document. Readable by you. Readable by any AI system you hand it to.



### The Sections

The document has eight sections. Seven core, one optional. If this feels like a lot, relax. You've already done most of the work. Each section draws directly from a chapter you've already read. You're not starting from scratch. You're organizing what you've found.

**Section 1: Where I Came From**

Your background. Your formative experiences. The patterns you recognized in the first two chapters. Where you came from, what shaped you, where you are now. Not a resume, not the polished version you'd put on a dating profile, but the real one, the one that includes the parts you usually leave out.

**Section 2: My Foundation**
Examine the current state of the Five Pillars. What's working. What keeps collapsing. Where you started versus where you are now. Your cascade patterns, which pillar drags the others down when it slips, which one pulls them forward when it improves.

**Section 3: Where I Am Going**

This is your Chapter Three and Five material. The goals that survived the Effortless Goals filter, if any did. The core desires you found when you kept asking "why?" or the directional seeds you created. Your pillar seeds, Your life domain seeds. "I am becoming someone who..." for each area that matters to you.

**Section 4: My Relationship with Gain and Loss**

How do you relate to winning and losing? What did your Post-Achievement Audit reveal? What did your gains actually give you versus what you expected? What did loss teach you that success couldn't?


**Section 5: What I Need From AI**

This might be the most practically useful section. How do you want AI to talk to you? What should it push back on? What should it absolutely not do?

If you respond well to directness, say so. If motivational cheerleading makes you want to throw your phone, say that. If you need AI to flag when you're running old scripts, write it down. If there are areas where you want help and areas where you don't, make it explicit.

This section shapes every future conversation. Without it, you get the default. The default is designed to be safe and pleasant, which usually means fucking useless.

**Section 6: My Story (Optional)**

If you go on to Chapter Eight and construct your Kishōtenketsu narrative, it goes here. The document is complete without it. The story adds depth for those who want it: the feeling behind the facts, the arc that connects the dots.


**Section 7: Revision log**

Keep a revision log not because anyone's checking, but because the changes themselves tell a story. "March 2027- updated Section 5, old seed no longer resonates, replaced with one that reflects where I actually am." "June - rewrote Section 3 after processing shutting down the company." The log becomes a record of your own evolution, visible over time.

I'll be honest, most people won't maintain Me.md. Most people will write a version, feel satisfied, and let it gather dust. And that's okay. Even a single honest version, written once, is more self-knowledge than most people ever organize. It will still serve you when you paste it into a conversation two years from now. It just won't serve you as well as one you've kept current.


### How to Build It

Don't try to write the whole thing in one sitting. That's the same "overhaul everything at once" trap I warned about with the pillars. You didn't fix all five pillars in a weekend, and you won't write this document in one session. The flywheel principle applies here too: start where the friction is lowest and let momentum build. For most people, that's Section 3, your goals and seeds.

Section 5 (what you need from AI) is worth spending real time on. Think about every frustrating interaction you've had with an AI system. What went wrong? What did you wish it had done instead? What tone works for you and what doesn't? Be specific. "Don't be overly positive" is okay. "When I'm catastrophizing, call it out directly instead of validating the spiral" is better. Think of this section as instructions for a very capable but very new assistant who wants to help but doesn't know you yet.

A few things to remember while you build this:

The first version is a draft. It will be incomplete and imperfect. That's fine. A rough document with honest material is infinitely more useful than a polished one full of what you think you should say. This isn't a college application essay. Nobody is grading it. The only measure of quality is honesty. If a section feels uncomfortable to write, you're probably doing it right. The document that makes you cringe a little is the one that will actually be useful. Leave sections blank if you're not ready. A gap in the document is better than filler. You can come back to it. The document isn't going anywhere.


### Before You Share It With AI

Be aware that when you use a cloud AI service, your conversation is sent to servers controlled by that company. What happens next depends on their policies. Some providers store your conversations indefinitely. Some use them to train future models, meaning your words become part of the system's learning material. Some allow employees to review conversations for quality and safety. Policies vary between providers, change over time, and are often buried in terms of service that nobody reads.

It's worth noting how these models were built in the first place. Most large language models were trained on enormous amounts of data scraped from the internet, much of it without the consent of the people who created it. It's documented, litigated, and ongoing, showing that they are more than willing to steal.

That said, let's be honest with ourselves... Most of us pour deeply personal information into email services, messaging apps, and social media without a second thought. People confess secrets over Snapchat and send medical details through unencrypted email boxes with 12345 as there password. The document you've built deserves more care than that, but the point isn't to be more paranoid about AI than you are about everything else.

There is an alternative. Local AI models run entirely on your own machine. Nothing leaves your computer. No servers, no storage policies, no training data contributions, no third-party access. The technology is moving fast. Models that run on a powerful laptop are already capable enough to work with your document in meaningful ways, and they're improving rapidly.

The tradeoff today is capability. The largest cloud models are generally more capable than those that run locally. That gap is closing, but it exists. For some conversations, the cloud model's additional capability might matter. For others, a local model is more than sufficient. You get to decide where that line is for you. For me, I only share my full story on my own local machine, a technical luxury that I think is worthwhile for me.

At minimum, before you paste your document into any AI system, know the answers to these questions: Does this provider store my conversations? Can I delete them? Are they used for training? Can I opt out? If you can't find clear answers, assume the worst.


### How to Use It

The most immediate use is pasting it into the beginning of any AI conversation, whether career advice, emotional support, or decision-making. One practical note: don't always use the full document. Your complete story is a lot of text, and flooding a conversation with too much context can actually degrade the quality of the output. Share the sections that are relevant to what you're working on. If you're making a career decision, the AI doesn't need your full health history. Be selective.

Take a simple question: "I'm thinking about changing careers. What should I consider?"

Without your document, you get generic advice about researching industries and updating your resume. With your document, you get a response that knows your pattern of fusing identity with achievement, that knows your sleep collapses when you're stressed, that knows you're prone to chasing external validation when you feel insecure, and that knows your seed is "I am becoming someone who creates from genuine interest rather than proving worth." The advice that comes back from that foundation is a different species entirely.

Beyond AI conversations, the document works as a decision-making filter. When an opportunity appears, when a choice needs to be made, pull up the document. Does this align with my seeds? Does this serve my actual desires or my inherited scripts? Does this strengthen my pillars or undermine them?

Share it with a therapist or coach if you have one. Most professionals spend the first several sessions trying to understand who you are. The document gives them a head start. It's not a replacement for the relationship, but it's a hell of a starting point.

Use it with people you trust. Not as a "here, read my life story", but as a reference when you're making decisions together, working through problems, or trying to explain where you're coming from. "Here's what I've figured out about myself" is a powerful thing to be able to hand someone.

The document is not a script. It doesn't tell you what to do. It tells you who you are and where you're pointed. The decisions still require judgment, courage, and occasionally dumb luck. The document just makes sure you're making those decisions with your eyes open.

Now, if you're the kind of person who wants to take this further, who wants to weave all of this material into a coherent narrative, a story of who you've been and who you're becoming, the next chapter shows you how.
