## Chapter Five: Real Winners Quit

### A Bet You Can't Afford to Lose

The Effortless Goals method from Chapter Three filters out fantasy timelines and misaligned desires. The previous chapter showed what happens even when goals succeed. For most people, that's enough to move forward with clarity.

But some of you may have noticed that something felt off. Not with the method, with the goals themselves.

If this is not you, go back to the Effortless Goals and live a happy life. Fucking with the internal wiring of yourself is risky business, and most of the time counterproductive. For those who remain, let me give you the short version: The only way to never lose is to quit the game and make up your own.


### The Trap Door

The Effortless Goals method asks you to drill down to your core desire. "I want to start a podcast" becomes "I want recognition" becomes "I want to feel like I matter." The method then asks you to create a goal that serves that desire, minimize it, and multiply the timeline by 10.

Here's what I didn't tell you: if you do this honestly, most goals don't survive. You drill down to the real desire, "I want to feel like I matter", and suddenly the podcast looks ridiculous. It was never going to deliver that. The goal doesn't fail the filter. It just stops making sense. If you really think about it, you start to see that having goals is not going to be the solution.

This is the trap door. Radical self-honesty doesn't just refine goals. It evaporates them.

And then you're left with a strange question. If no goal seems to deliver what you actually want, who sold you the importance of goals in the first place?


### Inherited Scripts

Turns out most goals aren't yours. You pursue something because you'd feel ashamed, guilty, or anxious if you didn't. It *feels* internal. You experience it as your own wanting. But the source is external: parents, culture, peers, social media, some ambient sense of what success is supposed to look like.

The narrative installation happens early and runs deep. From the moment you start making sense of the world around you, you absorb what your family considers desirable and what they don't. Schools teach you to discipline yourself, cooperate with others, obey rules, and test your achievements through competition. Media projects images of idealized lifestyles, bodies, and products. By the time you're making "your own" decisions about career and life, you've already internalized thousands of hours of programming about what success looks like, what kind of person is worthy of respect, what you should want.

None of this is conspiracy. It's just how humans work. We're social animals built to absorb the norms of our tribe. The problem isn't that socialization exists. The problem is that we mistake the installed software for our own operating system.

Psychologists have a term for this, introjected motivation. You take in a value but don't accept it as your own. You pursue the goal because you "ought to", because some part of you learned that this is what good people do. Kennon Sheldon's research found that introjected motivation predicts short-term persistence but not long-term wellbeing. Even when you succeed at introjected goals, anxiety indicators remain elevated. You won the game, but you're not happier. Sound familiar?

When Sheldon and Lawrence Krieger studied 6,200 lawyers, they found that income, class rank, partnership status, and law review membership had minimal to zero correlation with wellbeing. Public service lawyers reported higher wellbeing than elite firm lawyers despite markedly lower pay. The external markers of success, the ones everyone told you to chase, don't work. Krieger's conclusion was blunt: the American Dream paradigm (money, status, and external markers as foundations of a happy life) simply does not work. Not for lawyers, not for anyone.

Mary H. Jacobsen's "hand-me-down dreams" concept captures it well: if your family's values mesh with your own, you can find strength in them. If they don't, you'll build a career that your parents take pride in, but that slowly kills you inside. The same applies to cultural scripts, social media comparison, and every other source of "should."

Most people are running programs they didn't write, pursuing goals they didn't choose, winning games that don't satisfy.


### The Vacuum Problem

So you quit the inherited games. Now what?

Nothing happens without a difference. Physics calls it a gradient: pressure, heat, electrical potential. You need to want something for anything to move. I assumed that eliminating all desire would achieve peace, yes, but also paralysis.

Like many before me, I sought refuge in Eastern philosophies. Taoism and Buddhism seemed to offer a way out: eliminate craving, eliminate suffering. Extremely attractive. And it works, for a while. Dive deep enough into stillness and the suffering quiets.

But so does everything else.

I'd built a false choice in my head: either keep chasing scoreboards and suffer, or disengage completely, become a stone Buddha hidden in a cave, feeling nothing. I didn't want either. I wanted to be engaged with life, to create, to contribute, to feel the energy that comes from having direction. Just not enslaved to someone else's scoreboard.

Turns out I had misunderstood the teaching entirely.

Buddhism doesn't teach elimination of all desire. It distinguishes between two types. **Taṇhā** is compulsive craving, the thirst that's never quenched. **Chanda** is wholesome aspiration, chosen motivation. The tradition treats taṇhā as the root of suffering, but considers chanda a foundation for genuine growth.

The difference is where the desire points. A Thai Forest teacher put it simply: taṇhā wants to *get*. Chanda wants to *do*.

"I want to lose 10 kg" is taṇhā. Focused on an outcome. You either get there or you don't. "I am becoming someone who takes care of their body" is chanda. Focused on the doing.

Taṇhā perpetuates itself. You lose the weight. Brief satisfaction, then the goalpost moves. Tone up. Build muscle. Maintain it. The craving keeps going because it was never about the action; it was about getting somewhere. You're always behind, always not-yet-there.

Chanda works differently. Each action satisfies. The direction continues, but not from craving, from engagement. The walk today isn't a down payment on future satisfaction. It is the satisfaction.


### Wanting Is Not Liking

Before we get to the solution, one more piece of bad news. Your brain is designed to keep you chasing, not to reward arrival.

Kent Berridge, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, spent decades studying dopamine. The popular understanding is that dopamine is the "reward chemical," the thing that makes you feel good when you get what you want. Berridge proved this is wrong.

Dopamine mediates *wanting*, not *liking*. These are separate neural systems. About 90% of the nucleus accumbens (a key brain structure in motivation) generates intense wanting with zero pleasure-enhancing capacity. We can desperately chase things that won't satisfy us. Not because we're weak or stupid, but because that's how the system is built.

Berridge's quote on his own discovery: "I was absolutely convinced that dopamine was pleasure when I began my career, I loved that hypothesis... but results turned out otherwise."


### Quit the Game, Write Your Own

So goals are fragile. The external markers of success have near-zero correlation with wellbeing. What's left?

Direction. Not a destination, but a trajectory. Not an outcome to achieve, but an orientation to embody.


### Directional Narratives

Goals are finite; you either achieve them or fail. Narratives are directional; they point somewhere without requiring arrival.

"I want to lose 10 kg" is a goal. It succeeds or fails. "I am becoming someone who takes care of their body" is a narrative. It can't fail in the same way. Every action either aligns with the story or doesn't. There's no finish line.

This is what I call a Directional Narrative. It's the practical expression of chanda, wanting to *do*, not wanting to *get*.

### Narrative Seeds

A Directional Narrative starts with what I call a seed. A simple statement: "I am becoming someone who..." You plant them and let them grow.

Your seeds should cover the domains that matter to you: your health, your relationships, your work, your creativity, whatever is real for you. "I am becoming someone who builds things that matter to me." "I am becoming someone who shows up for the people I care about." "I am becoming someone who moves through the world rather than hiding from it."

Start with one or two. You don't need a seed for everything. You need seeds for the things that are actually pulling you.
