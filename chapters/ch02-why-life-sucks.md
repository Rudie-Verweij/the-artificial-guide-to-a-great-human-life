## Chapter Two: Why Life Sucks


### Adrenaline Juice

We wake up, the alarm blaring too early, as we open our phone, we submerge our brain in senseless stimulation, we make our way to the coffee machine and load up on adrenaline juice. Our belongings around us are shiny but grey, devoid of meaning. We get into our car, a marvel of modern engineering that we come to know as another headache in our over-complicated lives. During our drive, we listen to a motivational podcast that helps us rationalise our absurd life choices. We clock in, do our work in a foggy state, just to clock out and make our way back home, where we find ourselves devoid of motivation and loading up on processed food and other substances to feel any sense of relief...

What the fuck happened?

Ever since the first life forms replicated a long time ago, we have been collectively at war with Entropy, so nature created countless ways to ensure the stability of this rare pocket of order. Then, not so long ago, Humans came to be, with their ability to simulate the world and generate complex thoughts all inside portable supercomputers in their hardened skulls. A bold move, but one that came with many consequences. Most of us are now convinced that nothing happens if we don't think about it; we must plan and act to get anything done in the world, and struggle has become a mental proxy for success. The more we struggle, the more successful we become. Nothing could be further from the truth.


### €500 steak dinners

My personal relationship with ambitions started early. As a kid, after years of confusion, I was identified as what's called a "visual-spatial thinker," a processing style where you think in pictures rather than words. This manifested in very poor performance at school and laid the groundwork for a socially incapable, insecure kid who felt rather lost in life. I was fortunate with my parents, who were financially capable and willing to invest time in me. They arranged the help of experts who eventually got me to a level where I could function in the lower education system.

Outside of school, I started to develop technical hobbies that gave me the sense that I could be good at something, that I was allowed to be here, as I could provide something of value. This slowly turned into an obsession that would consume me and push me towards an entrepreneurial path.

Many years later, I co-founded a deep tech startup where we raised millions, travelled the world on a monthly basis and became a familiar face in the Dutch deep tech scene. I used some of my newfound wealth to experience the finer things in life, €500 steak dinners, the best wines in the world and other hedonic pleasures (the kind that feel good in the moment but don't stick). As expected, these pleasures were not really solid, and this was not a big surprise to me. However, what did surprise me was the pain my lifestyle was generating. As the years went on, I found myself heading towards a destructive lifestyle, fueled by stress and the need to prove my worth, accumulating more wealth while feeling poorer than ever. I assumed the problem was my circumstances... It wasn't. It was how I'd been taught to use my mind.


### Your mental "Knife"

The brain seems to be designed not to be satisfied with what it has. Throughout history, any organism that was content and felt it had its fair share would find itself wiped out when the good times ended and the bad times took all who were underprepared. This gradual sharpening of our mental "knife" has left us with a sense of inadequacy that seems to be deeply ingrained in us. People seek to dull their minds through drugs or other distractions, but this only temporarily degrades the edge, soon to be sharpened again. In all honesty, my previous wish for my mental knife not to be sharp missed the mark entirely, as the pain that you feel is inflicted by the improper use of the tool, not the quality of its edge. We are taught from a young age to always apply our conscious mental faculties to solve problems. If you do not succeed, one should apply more force, and there is merit to this statement, but a lot more happens in a kitchen than just the cutting of produce. Imagine you're a chef in your very own kitchen. Your chef's knife is your most important tool, but there are many others, most of which have deep internal logic, like the gas stoves, suction hoods and microwaves. They seem automatic in nature and perform magical feats, yet for your day-to-day, most of your time is spent on your knife; you learn how to use it while disregarding the rest of your equipment.


### How to be rich

A common question in my circles centres around how to become rich, wealthy, famous, happy, powerful, etc. The short answer is you will never become any of this, you can not be rich, you can only experience the feeling of richness. This may sound trivial, but it reveals a crucial hint: the only true difference between being successful and a failure is how you interpret your situation. For most, it is a moving goal that one will never reach. There has been much effort spent on how to achieve your goals, how to push yourself to get your dream car, house, vacation, wagyu steak and much more. Unfortunately, we forgot to ask the only question that matters: what is this goal actually for? Complete the wrong goal and you may end up further from where you want to be.

The patterns you recognized in this chapter (how you relate to struggle, what you chase, what drains you) become raw material for a document you'll build later. For now, just notice the patterns.
