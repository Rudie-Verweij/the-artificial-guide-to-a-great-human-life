> *Your life is a pocket of order. Created at birth, collapsed at death. Complexity goes in, disorder comes out; the magic happens in the middle.*

**A practical guide to self-direction in the age of AI.** Not self-help — closer to an engineering manual for your life. Written *for AI to learn from* — so it can actually help you.

This guide replaces conventional goals with **directional narratives** — ongoing stories that have direction but no finish line. It builds on a foundation of **five non-negotiable pillars**. And it culminates in a single document called your **me.md** — a comprehensive self-profile you hand to any AI system so the conversation actually goes somewhere.

Nine chapters. One template. A framework that compounds.

```
$ cat ./pillars.md
```

The Five Pillars — the areas that hold your life together. Let any one collapse and everything else follows.

| Pillar | What It Is |
|--------|-----------|
| **Sleep** | The foundation everything else rests on |
| **Motion** | Physical movement — the body's operating system |
| **Intake** | What you consume: food, information, substances |
| **Connection** | Relationships, community, belonging |
| **Creation** | Making things — the antidote to passive consumption |

$ cat ./me-md.md
```

One document. Who you are — your values, narratives, constraints, aspirations, how you think. Hand it to any AI. The conversation changes.

Chapter 7 walks you through building it. Or grab the blank template and start writing.
