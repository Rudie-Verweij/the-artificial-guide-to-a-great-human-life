# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## What's welcome

- **Issues and suggestions** — If something is unclear, broken, or could be better, open an issue. I read everything.
- **PRs for the ai-guide and templates** — If you have improvements, better prompts, or useful additions, submit a PR.
- **PRs for the book chapters** — If you spot errors, have clarifications, or want to suggest improvements to the guide itself, PRs are welcome. I'll review them to keep the voice coherent, but I'd love to build this with the community.
- **Translations** — If you want to translate the guide, reach out first so we can coordinate.

## Tone
