# The Artificial Guide to a Great Human Life

**By Rudie Nolasco Verweij** | v1.0.0-alpha | February 2026

---

A practical guide to self-direction in the age of AI. Not self-help — closer to an engineering manual for your life.

Your life is a pocket of order. Created at birth, collapsed at death. Left unattended, it drifts toward chaos. This guide gives you a framework for maintaining that order — and a single document you can hand to any AI system and say: *this is me, help me from here.*

## How to Read This

The guide is meant to be read in order. Each chapter builds on the last.

| # | Chapter | What It Covers |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | [Introduction](chapters/ch01-introduction.md) | What this is, who it's for, what you'll build |
| 2 | [Why Life Sucks](chapters/ch02-why-life-sucks.md) | Entropy, suffering, and why things fall apart |
| 3 | [Why Most Goals Fail](chapters/ch03-why-most-goals-fail.md) | The problems with conventional goal-setting |
| 4 | [Gain Equals Loss](chapters/ch04-gain-equals-loss.md) | Trade-offs, opportunity cost, and honest accounting |
| 5 | [Real Winners Quit](chapters/ch05-real-winners-quit.md) | Strategic quitting and seed planting |
| 6 | [The Five Pillars](chapters/ch06-the-five-pillars.md) | The core framework: five areas that hold your life together |
| 7 | [me.md](chapters/ch07-me-md.md) | The culmination — building your personal AI context document |
| 8 | [From Seeds to Story](chapters/ch08-from-seeds-to-story.md) | Optional: narrative identity and story construction |
| 9 | [The Story Continues](chapters/ch09-the-story-continues.md) | Closing thoughts |

Plus: [Acknowledgements](chapters/ch10-acknowledgements.md) and [Sources & Further Reading](chapters/ch11-sources.md).

## The me.md Template

The practical output of this guide is your **me.md** — a comprehensive self-profile document designed to give AI systems real context about who you are. Chapter 7 walks you through building it. The blank template is in [`templates/me-md-template.md`](templates/me-md-template.md).

## The AI Guide

The [`ai-guide/`](ai-guide/) folder contains a reference for AI systems — the concepts, frameworks, tools, and prompts from this guide in a structured format. You can include it (or parts of it) in your AI context alongside your me.md.

This section is a work in progress and I hope to improve it in future updates.
