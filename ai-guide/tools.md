## Reality Multiplier (RM)

**Purpose:** Counter planning fallacy by applying realistic effort estimate
**Context:** Step 5 of Effortless Goals framework

### Procedure

1. Estimate hours/week dedicated to goal
2. Estimate weeks/months/years duration
3. Calculate total hours
4. **Multiply by 10**
5. Assess: "Do I still want this?"

### Examples

**Low commitment:**
- Original: "Learn Spanish, 4hr/week, 3 months" = 48 hours
- After RM: 480 hours = ~2.5 years at 4hr/week
- Alternative: 8hr/week → ~1 year

**Side project:**
- Original: "6-month side project" = 50 hours
- After RM: 500 hours = 2-3 years

**Business comparison:**
- Minimized: "Small business 6mo" → 5 years
- Ambitious: "Large business 2yr" → 20 years
- Insight: 6mo vs 2yr original → 5yr vs 20yr actual (4× difference becomes 15yr difference)

### Diagnostics

**If motivation killed:**
| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Desire not strong enough | Return to radical self-honesty |
| Time commitment too low | Increase if goal responds to more hours |
| Didn't minimize properly | Find smaller version |

**If feels easy:**
- Likely: Original estimate was fantasy
- Action: Revisit timeline with more honesty before applying multiplier

### Notes

- Some goals have natural pacing limits (more hours won't help)
- Some goals exponentially benefit from concentration
- RM protects from the common scenario: massive underestimation
- Rare early completion = luck or vastly underestimated capabilities

## Post-Achievement Audit (PAA)

**Purpose:** Extract learning from gains (which the brain naturally skips)
**Context:** Chapter 5 - Gain Equals Loss

### Premise

After success, brain closes book (active inhibition of goal-related info). Credits self, misses luck, learns wrong lessons. ∴ Deliberate examination required.

### Procedure

#### 0. Separation
Remind yourself: this gain ≠ self-worth definition

#### 1. Expected Feeling
**Question:** "What did I expect to feel?"

Be specific: security from promotion, satisfaction from purchase, peace from milestone.

#### 2. Actual Feeling
**Question:** "What did I actually feel?"

**Probes:**
- Was it what expected? More? Less? Different?
- How long before baseline reasserted?

#### 3. Cost Assessment
**Question:** "What did this cost me?"

**Domains:** Time, energy, relationships, opportunities foregone

#### 4. Exposure Created
**Question:** "What new exposure does this create?"

**Probes:**
- What must I now maintain? Protect? Live up to?
- What can I now lose that I couldn't before?

#### 5. Near Misses
**Question:** "What almost went wrong?"

**Source:** Ellis research—most effective element of success review

**Probes:**
- What could have derailed this?
- What did I get away with?

### Outcomes

- **Immediate:** When loss comes, hurts less (identity not built on outcome)
- **Long-term:** Better future success odds (learned actual reasons, not stories)

### Retrospective Use

If reading after the crash:

**Reframe:** You only lost because you had something. Pain proportional to what you had = proof you played. Loss ≠ proof of wrong action; = proof you did something.

**Action:** Can still do audit in retrospect to extract value.

## Narrative Seeds (NS)

**Purpose:** Generate directional statements for narrative construction
**Context:** Step 2 of DN construction sequence

### Formula

**"I am becoming someone who [direction, not destination]"**

### Pillar Seeds

| Pillar | Seed |
|--------|------|
| Sleep | "I am becoming someone who respects their need for rest" |
| Motion | "I am becoming someone who moves through the world rather than hiding from it" |
| Intake | "I am becoming someone who builds their body with intention" |
| Connection | "I am becoming someone who shows up genuinely for the people in my life" |
| Creation | "I am becoming someone who makes things that matter to them" |

### Extension Domains

- Relationships: "I am becoming someone who [relational direction]"
- Work: "I am becoming someone who [professional direction]"
- Community: "I am becoming someone who contributes to my community"
- Learning: "I am becoming someone who [growth direction]"
- Add domains meaningful to individual

### Properties

- Not goals (no success/failure)
- Directional (points somewhere without requiring arrival)
- Can be communal or individual
- Derived from core desires identified in EG Step 2

### Generation from Failed Goals

**Process:**
1. Goal dies in EG filter → examine underlying desire
2. Desire (security | acceptance | autonomy | competence) → translate to direction

**Example:**
- Dead goal: "Make $1M" (died at RM step)
- Underlying: Security (freedom from financial anxiety)
- Seed: "I am becoming someone who builds sustainable security through [specific domain]"

## Story Construction Sequence

**Purpose:** Build Kishōtenketsu narrative from raw materials
**Context:** Chapter 8 - From Seeds to Story (optional)

### Inputs Required

- **Dump:** Raw past narrative (unedited, as currently remembered)
- **Seeds:** Narrative seeds from all relevant domains
- **Pillar status:** Current state of Five Pillars

### Prerequisite Check

**Condition:** FP reasonably stable
**If unstable:** Defer narrative work → stabilize pillars first

### Sequence

#### 1. Dump
- **Action:** Write story as currently remembered
- **Mode:** Unedited, capture dominant narrative
- **Expect:** May be darker/more scattered than anticipated

#### 2. Seeds
- **Action:** Generate NS for FP + other domains
- **See:** Narrative Seeds section above

#### 3. Ten
**Components:**
- **Buildup:** Recent events, crises, falling apart, accidental encounters
- **Foundation:** Implementing Five Pillars, stabilizing to author, creating gap between difficult feelings and growth ability
- **Peak:** The authoring itself, taking the pen, this moment of narrative creation

#### 4. Ketsu
- **Action:** Envision where seeds point (direction, not destination)
- **Nature:** Open-ended, story continues beyond
- **Question:** "What does life look like living aligned with seeds?"
- **Output:** Next chapter (who becoming, not what achieving)

#### 5. Ki/Shō
- **Action:** Return to dump with new lens
- **Hunt for:** Unique outcomes / sparkling moments
  - Times not anxious
  - Moments did show up
  - Days pattern broke
- **Process:** Connect across time (remote → recent → present) → alternative narrative emerges
- **Name it:** "What would you call this pattern?"
- **Result:** Two stories about self; choose which to feed

### Synthesis Options

**Manual:** Weave by hand

**AI-assisted:**
- Inputs: dump + seeds + Ten + Ketsu
- Request: Synthesize into coherent Kishōtenketsu narrative
- Requirement: Edit until feels like YOUR story
- See: [prompts.md](prompts.md) for templates

### Post-Construction

**Living it:**
- Nature: Lens (not script)
- Decision test: "Does this align with my story?"
- Difficulty test: "How does this fit the narrative I'm building?"

**Evolution:**
- Principle: Narrative identity = internalized AND evolving
- Action: Revisit periodically; each pass reveals new understanding

## Unique Outcomes Hunt

**Purpose:** Find exceptions to dominant problem-saturated story
**Context:** Step 5 of story construction (reconstructing Ki/Shō)
**Source:** Narrative therapy technique

### Definition

Actual events in your life that contradict the problem story. Times the pattern didn't hold. Overlooked because they don't fit the running narrative.

### Process

#### 1. Identify Dominant Story
Examples:
- "I'm someone who can't follow through"
- "I always sabotage good things"
- "I'm not the kind of person who..."

#### 2. Hunt Exceptions
**Questions:**
- "When was the last time that story wasn't true?"
- "What was different about that situation?"
- "What did you draw on?"

#### 3. Connect Across Time
- **Span:** Remote history → recent history → present
- **Effect:** Single exception (fragile) → pattern (alternative narrative)

#### 4. Name the Pattern
- **Question:** "What would you call this pattern you're describing?"
- **Effect:** Now have two stories; can choose which to feed

### Insight

Constructing new narratives actually changes how you remember the past. Memory becomes less painful. This isn't denial—it's reconstruction.

## me.md Builder

**Purpose:** Guide user through compiling their me.md from chapter work
**Context:** Chapter 7 — The me.md (culminating chapter)

### Procedure

#### Section by section

| Section | Source | Key Questions |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| 1. Where I Came From | Ch 1-2 reflections | Where did I come from? What shaped me? What patterns do I recognize? What's my current situation? |
| 2. My Foundation | Ch 6 assessment | Each pillar's current state? What's working, what keeps collapsing? Cascade patterns? Financial base? |
| 3. Where I Am Going | Ch 3 + Ch 5 work | Core desires? Inherited scripts (kept/discarded)? Goals that survived EG? Pillar seeds? Life domain seeds? Dominant story, unique outcomes, alternative narrative? |
| 4. My Relationship with Gain and Loss | Ch 4 work | PAA results? What gains actually gave vs. expected? What loss taught? Patterns in relationship with achievement? |
| 5. What I Need From AI | Self-reflection | Communication style? What to flag? What NOT to do? Where want help? Where don't? Decision-making principles? |
| 6. My Story (optional) | Ch 8 work | Kishōtenketsu narrative if constructed |

#### Construction tips

- **Start where friction is lowest** — usually Section 3 (seeds)
- **Section 5 deserves real time** — think about frustrating AI interactions; be specific
- **Don't write it all at once** — flywheel principle applies
- **Honest over polished** — rough + real > smooth + performative
- **Leave blanks** — gaps are better than filler; come back later

### Maintenance

- **Revision log:** Date every change and note why
- **Periodic review:** Revisit when life shifts — new job, relationship change, pillar collapse, new insight
- **Update triggers:** When a seed no longer resonates, when a section feels false, when you notice a new pattern
- **The log itself tells a story:** Changes over time reveal your evolution
