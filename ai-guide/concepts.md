## Problem Framing

### Entropy Principle
- **Definition:** Life = pocket of order; complexity in → disorder out
- **Implication:** Left unattended, drifts toward chaos
- **Question:** How to maintain order without burnout?

### Modern Condition
**Symptoms:**
- Hyperstimulation from wake
- Adrenaline dependence (caffeine, urgency)
- Possessions abundant but meaningless
- Foggy work state → substance relief cycle

**Root cause:** Struggle as mental proxy for success (false belief)

## Desire Types

### Taṇhā vs Chanda

| | Taṇhā | Chanda |
|---|-------|--------|
| **Type** | Compulsive craving | Wholesome aspiration |
| **Focus** | Result/outcome ("wants to GET") | Action itself ("wants to DO") |
| **Pattern** | Perpetuates itself, goalpost moves | Satiable, non-compulsive, each action satisfies |
| **Source** | Second Noble Truth (origin of suffering) | Four Bases of Spiritual Power |
| **Example** | "I want to lose 10kg" → achieve → want to tone → maintain → endless | "I am becoming someone who takes care of their body" → walk today = complete |

**Key insight:** "No finish line" ≠ endless wanting. It means you don't need a destination to feel fulfilled. Each aligned action is complete in itself.

### Wanting ≠ Liking

**Source:** Berridge, UMich dopamine research

**Finding:** Dopamine mediates *wanting*, not *liking*. These are separate neural systems. ~90% of nucleus accumbens generates intense wanting with zero pleasure-enhancing capacity.

**Implication:** We can desperately chase things that won't satisfy us—not because we're weak, but because that's how the system is built.

> "I was absolutely convinced dopamine was pleasure... results turned out otherwise." —Berridge

## Goal Pathology

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Goals

| Intrinsic | Extrinsic |
|-----------|-----------|
| Personal growth | Financial success |
| Meaningful relationships | Fame |
| Community involvement | Image/appearance |
| Physical health | |
| **→ Higher wellbeing** | **→ Lower life satisfaction** [Kasser & Ryan] |

### The Extrinsic Trap

Surface goals mask underlying needs:

| Surface Goal | Underlying Need |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Wealth | Security |
| Fame | Recognition that one matters |
| Perfect image | Self-acceptance |
| Status symbols | Competence recognition |

**Problem:** Extrinsic goals fail to satisfy the psychological needs they unconsciously address.

### Planning Fallacy

**Source:** Kahneman & Tversky, 1979

**Definition:** We underestimate time required even with past failure data—and don't learn from mistakes.

**Mechanisms:**
- **Memory bias:** Misremember how long tasks took
- **Simulation bias:** Imagine perfect execution without setbacks
- **Uniqueness bias:** See own goals as special/different [Flyvbjerg]

**Evidence:**
- 91.5% of megaprojects over budget/schedule [Flyvbjerg, 16,000 projects]
- <1% on time + on budget + deliver promised benefits
- Sydney Opera House: $7M estimate → $102M actual
- Channel Tunnel: £4.9B → £10B+

### Arrival Fallacy

**Definition:** Belief that achieving specific goal → lasting happiness

**Evidence:** Post-Olympic depression common despite lifetime achievement

**Mechanism:** Constant desire state as motivation → goal achieved → void

### Quitters Day

**Source:** Strava 2019, 800M users

**Finding:** New Year resolutions typically abandoned by January 19

**Supporting research:**
- 77% maintained 1 week, only 19% at 2 years [Norcross]
- 88% fail despite 52% initial confidence [Wiseman 2007, 3000 participants]

## Inherited Scripts

### Script Installation
- **Sources:** Parents, culture, peers, social media, ambient success norms
- **Timing:** From first world-comprehension; thousands of hours before "own" decisions
- **Mechanism:** Social animals absorb tribe norms (not conspiracy, just human design)
- **Problem:** We mistake installed software for our own operating system

### Introjected Motivation

**Definition:** Value taken in but not truly accepted as own

**Pattern:** Pursue because "ought to"—learned that "good people do this"

**Research:** Predicts short-term persistence but NOT long-term wellbeing [Sheldon]. Even success leaves anxiety elevated.

### Lawyer Study

**Source:** Sheldon & Krieger, 6,200 lawyers

**Finding:** Income, class rank, partnership, law review = minimal/zero correlation with wellbeing. Public service lawyers > elite firm lawyers (wellbeing) despite lower pay.

> "American Dream paradigm... does not work, for lawyers or anyone else."

### Hand-Me-Down Dreams
- **If values mesh:** Family values align with own → strength source
- **If values clash:** Career parents proud of → slowly kills inside

## Gain/Loss Dynamics

### Taoist Farmer Parable

Horse runs away ("bad luck") → returns with stallion ("good luck") → son breaks leg ("bad") → son survives war conscription ("good")

**Principle:** Good/bad luck create each other; gain/loss = one system turning

### Why Gaining Fails to Teach

**Mechanism:**
- After success, brain decides nothing to examine
- Goal-related info actively inhibited post-completion
- "What if" machinery doesn't activate (unlike failure)

**Consequences:**
- Credit self (skill attribution even when luck)
- Miss what almost went wrong
- Confident but incorrect beliefs [Zollo: superstitious learning]

**Evidence:** Managers' perceived success in acquisitions = negatively related to subsequent performance. We learn wrong lessons from unexamined wins.

### Contingent Self-Worth

**Source:** Crocker

**Finding:** Identity fused with outcomes → bigger highs, bigger crashes. Unfused = stable either way.

### Avoidance Costs

- **Short-term regret:** Actions dominate
- **Long-term regret:** Inactions dominate (72%) [Gilovich, Cornell]
- **Palliative finding:** #1 regret: "Wish I had courage to live true to myself" [Ware]
- **Adversity research:** Moderate adversity history → better mental health than high OR no adversity [Seery, 2400 people, 10yr]. Zero adversity = no coping capacity when loss arrives.

### Hold Lightly Principle

- **Practice:** While having thing, rehearse not having it (premeditatio malorum)
- **Test:** "If this disappeared tomorrow, would I still be me?" Answer should be yes.
- **Stance:** Pursue fully. Hold lightly.

## Narrative Identity

### Core Thesis

**Source:** McAdams (decades of research)

**Finding:** Identity IS your internalized evolving life story. You ARE story (not just tell stories).

### Redemption vs Contamination

| Redemption | Contamination |
|------------|---------------|
| Bad → good | Good → bad |
| Suffering transforms to growth | Positive experiences spoiled |
| → Higher generativity, wellbeing | |

### Narrative Primacy

**Source:** Adler, 47 adults, ~600 narratives

**Finding:** Stories changed BEFORE psychological wellbeing changed. People narrated new version → 1-2 weeks later wellbeing caught up.

**Alcoholic study:** Last-drink stories with redemption sequences: 83% stayed sober. Without redemption: 44%.

### Cultural Caveat

- **Western:** Redemption arcs dominant
- **Japanese:** May do better with acceptance, unresolved endings
- **Danish:** Emphasis on growing together, not solo triumph

∴ Shape depends on culture, relationships, self

## me.md (MD)

### Definition

A comprehensive self-profile compiled from all chapter work. Six core sections, one optional, plus a revision log. The book's culminating deliverable.

### Purpose

Gives any AI system full context for personalized assistance. Paste it into any AI conversation and the response transforms from generic to informed. Also works as a decision-making filter, a starting point for therapists/coaches, and a record of self-knowledge.

### Sections

| # | Section | Source | Contains |
|---|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Where I Came From | Ch 1-2 | Background, formative experiences, patterns, current situation |
| 2 | My Foundation | Ch 6 | Five Pillars current state, cascade patterns, entry point, financial base |
| 3 | Where I Am Going | Ch 3, 5 | Core desires, inherited scripts, goals that survived EG, pillar seeds, life domain seeds, dominant story, unique outcomes, alternative narrative |
| 4 | My Relationship with Gain and Loss | Ch 4 | PAA results, how you relate to winning/losing, what gains/losses taught you |
| 5 | What I Need From AI | — | Communication preferences, what to flag, what NOT to do, where you want help, decision-making principles |
| 6 | My Story (optional) | Ch 8 | Kishōtenketsu narrative if constructed |
| — | Revision Log | — | Dated record of changes and why |

### Relationship to DN and NS

The me.md CONTAINS the narrative seeds and (optionally) the full Kishōtenketsu story. It adds structured self-knowledge, AI interaction preferences, and pillar assessment that the narrative alone doesn't capture. Seeds remain the beating heart; the me.md is the container.

### Key Properties

- **Living document:** Meant to be revised as life evolves
- **Honest over polished:** A rough document with honest material > a polished one full of what you think you should say
- **Complete without the story:** Section 6 is optional; the document works without it
- **Privacy-aware:** Users should understand cloud AI storage policies before sharing; local AI is an alternative
