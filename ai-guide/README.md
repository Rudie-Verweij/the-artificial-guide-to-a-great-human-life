## Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| → | implies / leads to |
| ↔ | bidirectional relationship |
| ≠ | distinction / not same as |
| ∴ | therefore |

## Core Thesis

**Problem:**
Humans pursue inherited goals via compulsive craving (tanha), underestimate effort 10x, fuse identity with outcomes. Gain teaches nothing, loss destroys. Eliminating all desire creates a different trap: paralysis (the Vacuum Problem).

**Solution:**
Replace goals with directional seeds ("I am becoming someone who..."). Seeds express chanda (wholesome aspiration) not tanha (compulsive craving). Build a stable foundation (FP). Compile everything into the **me.md** (MD): a comprehensive self-profile that gives any AI full context to understand you. Optionally, weave seeds into a Kishōtenketsu narrative (Ch 8) for those who want the depth of story. Each action either aligns with your seeds or doesn't. No finish line. No failure mode.

**The me.md is the book's culminating deliverable.** Seeds are the mechanism. The story is optional depth.

## Usage Flow

### 1. Context (Ch 1-2)
- Understand entropy, modern condition, hyperstimulation
- Recognize where you are and what shaped you

### 2. Filter Goals (Ch 3)
- Apply EG method: surface goal → radical self-honesty → core desire → aligned goal → minimize → Reality Multiplier (x10)
- Goal survives? → proceed with clarity
- Goal dies? → the trap door opens (next steps)

### 3. Examine Gain and Loss (Ch 4)
- Understand why gaining fails to teach
- Apply PAA after achievements
- Practice holding lightly: pursue fully, attach loosely

### 4. Quit and Plant Seeds (Ch 5)
- Recognize inherited scripts
- Navigate the Vacuum Problem (not all desire is craving)
- Plant narrative seeds: "I am becoming someone who..."
- Seeds = chanda (wholesome aspiration), not tanha (compulsive craving)

### 5. Build Foundation (Ch 6)
- Check FP stability (sleep, motion, intake, connection, creation)
- If unstable → stabilize first, defer deeper work
- Understand flywheel dynamics: one pillar shifting creates space for the next
- Plant pillar-specific seeds
- Professional help is valid at any stage

### 6. Compile me.md (Ch 7)
- Organize all chapter work into 7 sections
- Start where friction is lowest (usually Section 3: seeds)
- Honest over polished; gaps better than filler
- Understand privacy: cloud vs local AI tradeoffs
- Token cost: don't always use full document; share relevant sections

### 7. Optional: Build Story (Ch 8)
- Only after me.md is done or done enough
- Kishōtenketsu structure: Ki → Sho → Ten → Ketsu
- Build backwards: dump → seeds (already planted) → Ten → Ketsu → reconstruct Ki/Sho
- Story goes into me.md Section 6

### 8. Maintain
- Periodic PAA after gains
- Revisit me.md as life evolves (Section 7: Revision Log)
- Revisit seeds as life evolves
- Setbacks become story material, not failure proof
- Share with therapist/coach for a head start on understanding you

## Safety Flags

### Defer deeper work if:
- FP severely compromised (no sleep, no movement, no connection, substance dependence)
- Acute crisis (dissociation, suicidal ideation, severe depression)
- **Action:** Professional support + pillar stabilization first. Professional help is not defeat; it's a willingness to fight.

### Watch for:
- **Rumination disguised as reflection:** cycling same thoughts, no insight, hot/churning feeling
- **Premature positivity:** forcing redemption before processing pain → shame spiral
- **Difficult material surfacing:** dump exercise may uncover trauma
- **Token flooding:** sharing full me.md when only sections are relevant degrades AI output quality
