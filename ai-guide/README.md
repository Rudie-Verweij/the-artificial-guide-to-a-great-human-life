## Core Thesis

**Problem:**
Humans pursue inherited goals via compulsive craving (taṇhā), underestimate effort 10×, fuse identity with outcomes. Gain teaches nothing, loss destroys.

**Solution:**
Replace goals with directional narratives (DN). DN = identity story pointing toward "becoming" not "achieving". Built on stable foundation (FP), using narrative seeds as the central mechanism. Culminates in the me.md (MD): a comprehensive self-profile that gives any AI everything it needs to understand you. Optionally, the Kishōtenketsu structure can weave seeds into a full narrative. Each action either aligns or doesn't. No finish line. No failure mode.

## Usage Flow

### 1. Assess
- Check FP stability (sleep, motion, intake, connection, creation)
- If unstable → stabilize first, defer narrative work
- Identify presenting goal/desire

### 2. Filter
- Apply EG method to surface goal
- Drill to core desire (security | acceptance | autonomy | competence)
- Apply RM (×10 timeline)
- Goal survives? → proceed | Goal dies? → use as DN seed

### 3. Construct
- Generate NS from FP + life domains
- Compile me.md from Ch 1-6 material (6 sections + optional story from Ch 8)
- Optionally: build Kishōtenketsu story backwards: dump → seeds → Ten → Ketsu → Ki/Shō
- Validate: reflection ≠ rumination, no premature positivity

### 4. Maintain
- Periodic PAA after gains
- Revisit me.md as life evolves (revision log)
- Revisit narrative/seeds as life evolves
- Setbacks become story material, not failure proof

## Safety Flags

### Defer narrative work if:
- FP severely compromised (no sleep, no movement, no connection, substance dependence)
- Acute crisis (dissociation, suicidal ideation, severe depression)
- **Action:** Professional support + pillar stabilization first

### Watch for:
- **Rumination disguised as reflection:** cycling same thoughts, no insight, hot/churning feeling
- **Premature positivity:** forcing redemption before processing pain → shame spiral
- **Difficult material surfacing:** dump exercise may uncover trauma
