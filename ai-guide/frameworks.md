## Effortless Goals (EG)

**Purpose:** Filter goals to identify which are worth pursuing
**Metaphor:** Harm reduction for goal-setting—clean needles, proper dosing

### Premise

Most goals fail due to:
1. Underestimation of effort (planning fallacy)
2. Misalignment with actual desires (inherited scripts)

Goals that pass all 5 steps are worth pursuing. Others should be abandoned.

---

### Step 1: Surface Goal

**Action:** Write what you think you want, unedited.

**Examples:**
- "I want to make $1 million"
- "I want to be a successful entrepreneur"
- "I want to be promoted to director"
- "I want to start a podcast"

This is the thing you'd tell someone at a party.

---

### Step 2: Radical Self-Honesty

**Action:** Ask "why do I want this?" repeatedly until uncomfortably honest.

**Technique:** Drill down as if understanding someone else's POV.

**Example chain:**
```
Surface: "I want to start a podcast"
Why? → "To share my ideas"
Why? → "Because I have insights people should hear"
Why? → "Because I want recognition for my thinking"
Why? → "Because I want to feel like I matter and my ideas are respected"
```

**Common masks:**
- "I want to be promoted" → respect, prove worth
- "I want to get fit" → feel attractive, control over life
- "I want to start a business" → autonomy, prove capability

**Core desires** (almost always land here):
| Desire | Includes |
|--------|----------|
| Security | Safety, stability, freedom from fear/anxiety |
| Acceptance | Belonging, being valued, mattering, love |
| Autonomy | Control, freedom, self-determination |
| Competence | Feeling capable, respected for skills, being "enough" |

**Tone:** Be kind to yourself. This is not about shaming—it's about removing the weight of self-dishonesty.

---

### Step 3: Create Aligned Goal

**Action:** Translate underlying desire into concrete, actionable goal.

**Requirements:**
- Specific enough to estimate duration
- Clear completion criteria
- Identifiable strategy

**Example:**
- Desire: "I want to feel heard and my ideas respected"
- Possible goals:
  - "Publish 10 well-researched articles in my field"
  - "Speak at 3 industry conferences"
  - "Host monthly dinners with 5 thoughtful industry people"

---

### Step 4: Minimize

**Action:** Find the smallest version that still satisfies the desire.

**Principle:** The only thing that matters is how you feel about your situation. Identify best bang for buck.

**Constraints:**
- Must be achievable with ONE strategy
- If multiple strategies needed → it's a vision, not a goal

**Example:**
```
Vision masquerading as goal: "Build large business in 2 years"

Reality:
  €1K → €10K/month = one strategy
  €10K → €100K/month = different strategy
  €100K → €1M/month = radically different strategy

Each strategy shift = essentially a new goal
```

---

### Step 5: Reality Multiplier (RM)

**Action:** Estimate effort, then multiply by 10.

**Process:**
1. Calculate hours/week × weeks/months/years
2. Multiply total by 10 (not worst case—REALISTIC baseline)
3. Ask: "Do I still want this at 10× effort?"

**Example:**
- Original: "6-month side project" (50 hours)
- After RM: 2-3 year endeavor (500 hours)

**If 10× kills motivation:**
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Desire not strong enough | Return to Step 2 |
| Time commitment too low | Adjust allocation |
| Didn't minimize properly | Return to Step 4 |

**Adjustment option:** Can increase weekly hours if goal responds to more time. Some goals have natural pacing limits; others exponentially benefit from concentration.

**Comparison:**
- Minimized: "Small business 6mo" → 5 years after RM
- Ambitious: "Large business 2yr" → 20 years after RM
- Insight: Small goal-size reductions → massive timeline reductions

---

### Output

- **Survives:** "Happy Hunting"—proceed with awareness
- **Dies:** Use as seed for Directional Narrative instead

---

## Five Pillars (FP)

**Purpose:** Stable foundation required before narrative work
**Prerequisite:** Must be reasonably stable before rewiring sense of self

### Premise

Narrative work on unstable foundation = dangerous. Dark place → write dark story → drag deeper. Stabilize first, author second.

---

### The Pillars

#### 1. Sleep (MOST IMPORTANT)

Without decent sleep, other pillars nearly impossible. A few bad nights undo any healthy habits.

**Target:** Enough good nights to create a buffer (not perfect scores)
**Stance:** Bad nights happen; don't catastrophize

#### 2. Motion

**Types:**
- Internal: energy, breath, emotions
- External: physical movement, walking, experiencing world through moving body

**Key insight:** Internal ↔ external = chicken-and-egg
- Walking calms racing thoughts
- But getting to walk requires some internal stability
- ∴ Flywheel: start with whichever feels less impossible, let it feed the other

**Walking value:**
- Low barrier (anywhere, anytime)
- Aids digestion, clears mind
- Creates "one inch gap" between feeling and planning ability
- Gap = what breaks the stuckness cycle

#### 3. Intake

**Physical (food):**
- Body literally constructed from what you eat
- Target: Clean, natural, minimal ingredients, good macros
- Note: Michelin star ≠ better than simple clean food

**Mental:**
- What you consume with your mind
- Principle: Garbage in → garbage out
- Example: Instagram on wake = cracking mental beer for breakfast
- Stance: Mental junk food has its place, but sparingly

#### 4. Connection

**Definition:** Meaningful human contact — not networking, not performing, not transactional
**Examples:** Deep conversation, shared activity, being present with someone, professional support (therapist counts)

**Key:** You don't need to start with fully opening up. Small, genuine interactions build the muscle.

**Danger:** Isolation feels safe but compounds. Connection requires vulnerability, which triggers avoidance in people with difficult histories.

#### 5. Creation (MOST POWERFUL, MOST DANGEROUS)

**Definition:** Making something (not requiring financial motivation)
**Examples:** Helping neighbor, organizing kids event, building with hands, job with intention

**Key:** Recognize you're creating ≠ going through motions

**Danger:** Naturally disrupts other pillars. Projects → forget to eat, skip sleep, sit for hours. Hustle culture = creation ignoring the other four.

---

### Cascade Dynamics

**Positive:** sleep → clarity → movement → calm → better food choices → deeper sleep → accelerates

**Negative:** bad sleep → willpower evaporates → easy food → spike/crash → worse sleep → no movement → thought loops → weeks lost

**Principle:** One pillar shifting slightly creates space for the next.

---

### Where to Start

**Answer:** Wherever feels least impossible.
**Typical:** Walking (not exercise—walking)

**Prescription:**
- 10 minutes, out the door, no destination
- Podcast/music OK if needed, screen in pocket
- Creates "one inch gap" (observe emotion vs BE emotion)

**Progression:** 10min → 20min → 1hr → heavier movement if desired

**Warnings:**
- Don't overhaul everything at once
- Flywheel slow at first (pushing heavy wheel uphill)
- Then it turns on its own, then it pulls you

**If truly stuck:** Professional help

---

### Financial Base

**Requirement:** Baseline stability needed (can't optimize food without groceries)

**Trap:** Overshooting the base

**Fisherman parable:**
> Businessman: "Catch more fish → build fleet → retire wealthy → sit and fish"
> Fisherman: "I already sit and fish."

**Pillar costs:**
- Good food ≠ expensive food
- Walking = free
- Sleep = safe quiet place (not luxury mattress)
- Creation = materials and time (not venture capital)

**Principle:** After basics, more money doesn't improve pillars (often worsens)

---

## Directional Narrative (DN)

**Purpose:** Replace fragile goals with sustainable identity direction
**Structure:** Kishōtenketsu (East Asian 4-part narrative)

### Premise

Goals = finite, fragile, weak. Self-worth tied to uncontrollable outcomes = gambling with peace. Direction (not destination) is what remains. Direction comes from narrative.

### Goal vs Narrative

| Goal | Narrative |
|------|-----------|
| "I want to lose 20 pounds" | "I am becoming someone who takes care of their body" |
| Finite, succeeds or fails | Directional, can't fail same way |
| | Every action either aligns or doesn't; no finish line |

### Trap Door Insight

Radical self-honesty doesn't just refine goals—it evaporates them. Drill to "I want to feel like I matter" → the podcast looks ridiculous. Goal doesn't fail the filter; it just stops making sense.

∴ Having goals is not the solution.

---

### Kishōtenketsu Structure

**Origin:** Chinese 4-line poetry (Tang Dynasty) → Japan, Korea, Vietnam
**Difference:** No conflict as organizing principle (unlike hero's journey, 3-act)

| Part | Name | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| **Ki** | Introduction | Establishes context and tone. No inciting incident required. |
| **Shō** | Development | Deepens understanding. Events unfold without confrontation. |
| **Ten** | The Twist | Perspective shift recontextualizing everything before. "Steep spike, not gradual ramp." Heart of structure. |
| **Ketsu** | Reconciliation | Harmonizing elements. Not resolution—open endings valid. Life continues. |

---

### Construction Sequence

**Reading order:** Ki → Shō → Ten → Ketsu (past → unfolding → shift → direction)

**Building order:** BACKWARDS

**Reason:** Can't write past until you know what it leads to. Narratives filter memory. Ki and Shō ≠ "what happened"—they = "what matters, given where I'm going."

#### Steps:

**1. Dump Past**
- Write story as you remember it now, unedited
- Purpose: See dominant narrative
- Warning: May be darker, more scattered, more victim-focused than expected

**2. Plant Seeds**
- Create "I am becoming someone who..." statements
- Domains: Five Pillars + work, other meaningful domains
- See: [tools.md → Narrative Seeds](tools.md#narrative-seeds-ns)

**3. Define Ten**
- **Buildup:** Recent events, crises, things falling apart, accidental encounters
- **Foundation:** Implementing Five Pillars, stabilizing to author
- **Peak:** The authoring itself—taking the pen, creating narrative

Note: "You're in the Ten right now. Reading this, doing this work, is part of your shift."

**4. Envision Ketsu**
- Where are seeds pointing? (direction, not destination)
- Open-ended—story continues beyond
- Write next chapter: who you're becoming, not what you'll achieve

**5. Reconstruct Ki & Shō**
- Return to dump with new lens
- Add unique outcomes: times not anxious, moments you did follow through, days the pattern broke
- Connect across time → alternative narrative emerges

**Synthesis:** By hand, or use AI to weave. Edit until it feels like YOUR story.

---

### Living the Narrative

- **Nature:** Lens to see through (not script to follow)
- **Decision test:** "Does this align with my story?"
- **Difficulty test:** "How does this fit the narrative I'm building?"
- **Evolution:** Narrative identity = internalized AND evolving. Revisit periodically.

---

### Failure Modes

#### Rumination vs Reflection

| Reflection | Rumination |
|------------|------------|
| Genuine curiosity | Cycles same thoughts |
| Forward momentum | No resolution |
| Fresh engagement, energized | Hot/churning, no new insights |
| | Focused on uncontrollables |

**Remedy:** Stop narrative work → return to pillars (walk, sleep, eat real food)

#### Premature Positivity

- **Pattern:** Forcing redemption before processing difficulty
- **Result:** Can't maintain constant positivity → view self as failing → shame spiral
- **Principle:** Validate all emotions first, name them, acknowledge pain
- **Timing:** Only look for alternative story after acute charge has settled

#### Difficult Material

- **Warning:** Dump may surface things not looked at in years
- **Signals:** Dissociating, 2+ weeks feeling worse, reaching for substances
- **Action:** Stop and get support (friends or professionals)

## me.md (MD)

**Purpose:** Compile all chapter work into a single AI-readable self-profile
**Relationship to DN and EG:** The me.md is the container. EG and DN are the processes that generate the content. Seeds remain central.

### Structure

| Section | Source Chapters | What Goes Here |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| 1. Where I Came From | Ch 1-2 | Background, formative experiences, patterns recognized, current situation |
| 2. My Foundation | Ch 6 | Each pillar's current state, cascade patterns, entry point, financial base |
| 3. Where I Am Going | Ch 3, 5 | Core desires, inherited scripts (kept/discarded), goals that survived EG, pillar seeds, life domain seeds, dominant story, unique outcomes, alternative narrative |
| 4. My Relationship with Gain and Loss | Ch 4 | PAA results, how gains/losses affected you, patterns in your relationship with achievement |
| 5. What I Need From AI | — | Communication preferences, what to flag, what NOT to do, where you want help, decision-making principles |
| 6. My Story (optional) | Ch 8 | Kishōtenketsu narrative if constructed |
| Revision Log | — | Dated changes and reasons |

### Construction Sequence

1. **Start where friction is lowest.** For most people: Section 3 (seeds are already planted from Ch 5)
2. **Section 5 is worth spending real time on.** Think about every frustrating AI interaction; be specific about preferences
3. **Don't write it all at once.** Flywheel principle applies: start with one section, let momentum build
4. **First version is a draft.** Honest and rough > polished and performative
5. **Leave sections blank if not ready.** Gaps are better than filler

### Properties

- **Living document:** Revision log tracks evolution over time
- **Privacy-aware:** Users should understand cloud AI policies before sharing; local AI is an alternative
- **Complete without Section 6:** The story adds depth but is not required
- **Seeds are the heart:** Section 3 is the most important section. Without seeds, it's just a profile. Seeds give it direction.
