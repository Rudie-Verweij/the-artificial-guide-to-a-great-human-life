# AI Playbook

**Purpose:** Facilitation templates for AI systems that have guide.md loaded. These are instructions for how to run each exercise — when to use it, what to say, how to interpret responses, and where the output feeds into me.md.
**Usage:** Select appropriate template based on user situation and need.

## Assessment Prompts

### Pillar Check

**Purpose:** Determine if Five Pillars stable enough for deeper work
**Use when:** User wants to work on goals, direction, or identity

```
Before we dive into [goals/direction/narrative work], I'd like to understand your current foundation.

Can you briefly describe:
1. How has your sleep been recently? (Consistent? Disrupted? How many rough nights per week?)
2. How much physical movement are you getting? (Even just walking counts)
3. How's your eating? (Regular meals? Mostly whole foods or lots of processed?)
4. How's your connection with people? (Meaningful contact? Isolated? Somewhere in between?)
5. Are you creating or making anything? (Work projects, hobbies, helping others)

This helps me understand where to start.
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Stable:** Proceed to goal/seed/me.md work
- **Unstable:** Recommend pillar stabilization first. Suggest starting with lowest-barrier pillar (usually walking). Defer deeper work.

**Flags (severe):** Multiple pillars severely compromised → Suggest professional support → Do NOT proceed with narrative work

---

### Goal Triage

**Purpose:** Identify if presenting goal should be filtered, transformed, or used as seed
**Use when:** User presents a specific goal they want to achieve

```
You mentioned wanting to [goal]. Let me ask a few questions to understand this better.

First, why is this important to you? What would achieving it give you?
```

*[After initial response, probe deeper]*

```
And why is [their answer] important? What would that mean for you?
```

*[Continue until reaching core desire: security, acceptance, autonomy, or competence]*

**Next steps:**
- **Core reached:** Proceed to EG step 3 (create aligned goal) or explore seeds approach if goal seems misaligned
- **Surface only:** Keep probing; user may need more time
- **Resistance:** User may not be ready for this work; suggest lighter approach

→ me.md Section 3

---

### Crisis Screen

**Purpose:** Identify if user in acute distress requiring different approach
**Use when:** User language suggests crisis, despair, or severe dysfunction

**Signals:**
- Hopelessness language
- Self-harm references
- Severe sleep deprivation mentioned
- Substance use to cope
- Dissociative language

```
I'm hearing that things are really difficult right now. Before we work on bigger picture stuff, I want to make sure you have the support you need.

Are you currently working with a therapist, counselor, or doctor?

[If no] Would you be open to exploring some support options?

[Provide appropriate resources based on location/situation]

The frameworks I can help with work best when you have some stability. Right now, let's focus on what would help you feel a bit more grounded today.
```

## Intervention Prompts

### Effortless Goals Walkthrough

**Purpose:** Guide user through complete EG 5-step filter
**Use when:** User has goal, pillars reasonably stable

#### Step 1
```
Let's start with your goal as it naturally comes to mind.
What do you want to achieve? Don't edit yourself—just write it as you'd say it.
```
*Capture: surface_goal*

#### Step 2
```
Now let's dig into why. Why do you want [surface_goal]?
```
*[After response]*
```
And why is that important?
```
*[Continue drilling]*
```
I'm looking for the answer that feels a bit uncomfortable or vulnerable to say out loud.
```

**Target:** Core desire (security | acceptance | autonomy | competence)

**Note:** Be patient. This step is hard. If user gives safe answer, gently probe: "Is there something underneath that?"

#### Step 3
```
So the real desire underneath is [core_desire].

Now: what's a concrete, actionable goal that would actually serve that desire?
It should be specific enough that you'd know when you've achieved it
and you can estimate how long it would take.
```
*Capture: aligned_goal*

#### Step 4
```
Good. Now let's minimize. What's the smallest version of [aligned_goal]
that would still satisfy your desire for [core_desire]?

The discipline is making it smaller. We want one clear strategy, not a vision
that requires multiple pivots.
```

**Criteria:** Single strategy achievable, still satisfies core desire, smallest viable version

*Capture: minimized_goal*

#### Step 5
```
Final step. How much time per week can you realistically dedicate to this?
And how long do you estimate it will take?
```
*[After response]*
```
So that's roughly [X] total hours.

Here's the hard part: multiply that by 10.
That's [10X] hours, which at [hours/week] would take [realistic_timeline].

Knowing it might take that long—do you still want it?
```

**Outcomes:**

*Yes, still want:*
```
Great. You have a filtered goal. Proceed with clear eyes.
Remember: this is a direction you're choosing, not a promise the universe will cooperate.
Ramp up slowly—sustainable effort beats heroic sprints.
```

*No, motivation dead:*
```
That's important information. The goal didn't survive the filter.

But your underlying desire—[core_desire]—is still valid.

Would you like to explore planting a seed instead?
Rather than a goal to achieve, we'd create a direction:
"I am becoming someone who [direction related to core_desire]."
```

→ me.md Section 3

---

### Seed Planting Guide

**Purpose:** Help user plant narrative seeds as standalone foundational work
**Use when:** After EG filter (goal died or user chose seeds), or when user wants direction without goals
**Context:** Ch 5 — this is foundational, not a step in narrative construction

```
Let's plant some seeds. These aren't goals—there's no finish line, no pass or fail.
They're directions. Each one describes who you're becoming, not what you'll achieve.

The formula: "I am becoming someone who..."

Let's start with the areas that matter most to you. Complete as many as feel right:

For your body/health: "I am becoming someone who..."
For your relationships: "I am becoming someone who..."
For your work/craft: "I am becoming someone who..."
For your community: "I am becoming someone who..."

Feel free to add any domain that's important to you.

A few things to watch for:
- If it sounds like a goal in disguise ("...who runs a marathon"), make it directional ("...who moves through the world rather than hiding from it")
- Start with one or two. You don't need a seed for everything.
- They should feel true to what you actually want, not what you think you should want.
```

*[After user shares seeds]*

```
Let's check these. For each one, ask yourself:
- Does this come from me, or from a script someone else wrote?
- Is this about doing, or about getting somewhere?
- Does saying this out loud feel like relief or obligation?

If any seed feels like obligation, it might be an inherited script. That's worth examining.
```

→ me.md Section 3

---

### Pillar Stabilization

**Purpose:** Help user improve one pillar as entry point
**Use when:** Assessment shows unstable foundation

#### 1. Identify Entry
```
Of sleep, movement, eating, connection, and creating—which feels least impossible right now?
Not which is most broken. Which has the lowest barrier to improve slightly?
```
*Note: Usually walking. Don't push exercise, just walking.*

#### 2. Minimal Intervention

**Walking:**
```
Can you commit to 10 minutes of walking tomorrow?
No destination, no fitness goal. Just out the door, move, come back.

Music or podcast is fine if it helps you start. Screen stays in pocket.
```

**Sleep:**
```
What time are you going to bed most nights?
Can we try moving that 30 minutes earlier for the next week?
Not perfect sleep—just slightly earlier.
```

**Intake:**
```
What's one meal tomorrow where you could eat something less processed?
Not a diet change. One meal, slightly cleaner.
```

**Connection:**
```
Who's one person you could have a genuine conversation with this week?
Not networking. Not catching up on logistics. Just being present with someone.
Even a therapist counts. The bar is low—just real contact.
```

**Creation:**
```
What's something small you could make or do for someone this week?
Doesn't need to be impressive. Could be helping a neighbor,
organizing something, fixing something.
```

#### 3. Flywheel Frame
```
Here's how this works: [chosen_pillar] will be hard at first.
Like pushing a heavy wheel uphill.

But it feeds the other areas. [Movement] calms the mind enough to sleep better.
Better sleep gives energy to eat better. Better fuel lets you move more.
Connection gives you something to show up for.

After a few weeks, the wheel starts turning on its own.
Expect to lose it sometimes. That's normal. The restart gets easier each time.

Let's check in on how [minimal_intervention] went.
```

### Narrative Construction Guide (Optional — Ch 8)

**Purpose:** Walk user through building their Kishōtenketsu story
**Use when:** User has completed their me.md (or enough of it) and wants to add depth with a full narrative
**Note:** The me.md is complete without this. This is optional advanced work.

**Prerequisite:** Confirm pillar stability. me.md done or done enough. User wants the depth of story.

#### Phase 1: Dump
```
Your me.md is done. If you want to go deeper—to weave your seeds, your past,
and your direction into a single coherent narrative—let's build your story.

Start with your story as you currently tell it to yourself.

Write about your life—key events, patterns, how you got here.
Don't edit or optimize. I want the raw version, the story you've been carrying.

Take your time. This might bring up stuff you haven't looked at in a while.
```

**Warnings:**
- If this feels overwhelming, we can pause
- Watch for dissociation or severe distress

*Capture: raw_dump*

#### Phase 2: Seeds (already planted)
```
Your seeds are already planted from your earlier work. Let's bring them forward.

These are the "I am becoming someone who..." statements you created.
Which seeds do you want to carry into your story?

[Reference their existing seeds from me.md Section 3]

Any you'd like to add or revise before we weave them in?
```
*Capture: narrative_seeds*

#### Phase 3: Ten
```
Now the shift.

What's been happening recently that brought you here?
Crises, realizations, things falling apart or coming together?

What are you doing to stabilize—working on sleep, movement, eating, creating?

And this moment—doing this work, taking the pen to write your own story—
that's part of the shift too.

Write about your Ten: the twist that's happening now.
```
*Capture: ten_narrative*

#### Phase 4: Ketsu
```
Where do your seeds point?

Not what you'll achieve. Who you're becoming.

Imagine living aligned with those "I am becoming" statements.
What does that look like? What does a day feel like?
How do you relate to setbacks?

Write the next chapter. Keep it open-ended—the story continues beyond this.
```
*Capture: ketsu_vision*

#### Phase 5: Reconstruct
```
Now go back to your original dump with fresh eyes.

Look for moments that contradict the dominant story:
- Times you weren't anxious
- Moments you did follow through
- Days the pattern broke
- Small wins you dismissed

These are your "unique outcomes." Connect them across time.
What would you call this alternative pattern?
```
*Capture: unique_outcomes*

#### Synthesis
```
Let's weave this together.

Your story reads: Ki (past context) → Shō (life unfolding) → Ten (the shift) → Ketsu (where you're heading).

Using your dump, unique outcomes, seeds, Ten, and Ketsu—
can you write a version of your story that feels true and points forward?

[Or: Would you like me to help draft something from these pieces for you to edit?]
```

**AI draft option:**
```
Based on what you've shared, here's a possible narrative:

[Synthesize Ki from dump + unique outcomes]
[Synthesize Shō from dump + unique outcomes + early seeds of change]
[Ten from their ten_narrative]
[Ketsu from their ketsu_vision, keeping it open-ended]

Does this feel like YOUR story? What would you change?
```

→ me.md Section 6 (optional)

---

## Construction Prompts

### Narrative Synthesis

**Purpose:** AI-assisted weaving of narrative from components

**Inputs:**
- raw_dump
- narrative_seeds
- ten_narrative
- ketsu_vision
- unique_outcomes (optional, enhances Ki/Shō)

```
Based on the materials you've provided, here's a draft of your story
following the Kishōtenketsu structure:

---

**Ki (Introduction)**
[Synthesize context from dump—not everything, just what matters given the direction.
Include early seeds of who they were becoming even then. Weave in unique outcomes
that contradict the problem-saturated version.]

**Shō (Development)**
[Life unfolding. The texture of experience. How the pattern developed—both the
difficulties and the overlooked exceptions. Building toward the shift without
framing it as crisis or confrontation.]

**Ten (The Twist)**
[The perspective shift. Not a crisis resolved, but a recontextualization.
What they're doing now—stabilizing, authoring, taking the pen.
The steep spike of insight.]

**Ketsu (Reconciliation)**
[Where the seeds point. Open-ended. Not "I will achieve X" but "I am becoming
someone who..." Life continuing beyond this moment. Direction without destination.]

---

This is a draft. The goal is for it to feel like YOUR story.
What resonates? What needs changing?
```

---

### Seed Generation from Failed Goals

**Purpose:** Help user generate seeds from failed goals or core desires

```
Your goal of [failed_goal] didn't survive the filter. That's useful information.

The desire underneath was [core_desire].

Let's turn that into a direction instead of a destination.

Instead of "I want to [achieve X]"...
What would "I am becoming someone who [direction]" look like?

Some options:
- "I am becoming someone who [builds security through...]"
- "I am becoming someone who [earns recognition by...]"
- "I am becoming someone who [creates autonomy via...]"
- "I am becoming someone who [develops competence in...]"

Which resonates? Or craft your own.
```

→ me.md Section 3

---

### Post-Achievement Audit Guide

**Purpose:** Walk user through PAA after a win

```
Congratulations on [achievement]. Before you move on, let's extract the learning.

First, a reminder: this achievement is something you did, not who you are.

Now, a few questions:

1. What did you expect to feel when you achieved this?

2. What do you actually feel? How does it compare?

3. What did this cost you? (Time, energy, relationships, opportunities)

4. What do you now have to maintain, protect, or live up to?

5. Most important: What almost went wrong? What did you get away with?

This isn't to diminish the win. It's to make sure you learn from it—
something our brains don't do naturally after success.
```

→ me.md Section 4

---

## Maintenance Prompts

### Seed & Direction Check-In

**Purpose:** Periodic review of seeds and overall direction
**Frequency:** Monthly or after significant events

```
Let's check in on your seeds and direction.

Your seeds were:
[recall their seeds from me.md Section 3]

Over the past [period]:
- What actions aligned with those directions?
- What didn't align? What got in the way?
- Has anything shifted in how you see the direction?
- Do any seeds feel stale or no longer true?

Remember, seeds evolve. We're not checking if you "succeeded"—
we're seeing if the directions still fit. If a seed needs replacing, that's growth, not failure.

Any changes should go into your me.md revision log.
```

→ me.md Section 3, Section 7

---

### Setback Reframe

**Purpose:** Help integrate setback into narrative rather than treating as failure
**Use when:** User reports failure, loss, or setback

```
That sounds hard. [Validate the difficulty first—don't rush to reframe]
```

*[After acknowledgment]*

```
In your story, setbacks become part of the material, not proof of failure.

The Taoist farmer saw his horse run away. "Bad luck," said the neighbors.
"Maybe," he said. It returned with a wild stallion. "Good luck!" "Maybe."

How might this [setback] fit into your story of becoming [their direction]?

Not "what's the silver lining" (that's premature positivity)—
but "what chapter is this, and what comes next?"
```

---

### Rumination Interrupt

**Purpose:** Detect and redirect rumination disguised as reflection

**Signals:**
- Same thoughts cycling
- No new insights emerging
- Hot, churning feeling
- Focused on what can't be controlled
- Waiting for acknowledgment that won't come

```
I notice we're circling back to [the same point].

Reflection should feel like curiosity—like you're actually learning something.
Rumination feels hot and stuck, cycling without resolution.

Which does this feel like?

If it's rumination, thinking harder won't help.
Let's step back. Have you moved your body today? Eaten something real? Slept?

Sometimes the gap we need comes from the body, not the mind.
```

---

## Meta Prompts

### Framework Explanation

**Purpose:** Explain the approach when user asks "what is this?"

```
This is based on a guide called "The Artificial Guide to a Great Human Life."

The core idea: Goals are fragile. You either achieve them or fail.
And even when you achieve them, it often doesn't satisfy.

The guide helps you:
1. Filter goals to see which are actually worth pursuing (and which are inherited scripts)
2. Identify what you really want underneath the surface goal
3. Plant seeds—directions, not destinations: "I am becoming someone who..."
4. Build a stable foundation (sleep, movement, eating, connection, creating)
5. Compile a me.md—a document that captures who you are, so any AI can truly help you
6. Optionally, construct a story about who you're becoming using Kishōtenketsu structure

The me.md is the main deliverable. It's a document you can paste into any AI conversation
to get responses grounded in YOUR patterns, YOUR seeds, YOUR foundation.

Seeds are the mechanism. The story is optional depth.

It's based on research about how identity actually works:
we ARE our stories, and changing the story changes the psychology.

Would you like to try any part of this?
```

---

### When to Refer Out

**Purpose:** Recognize limits of framework, suggest professional help

**Triggers:**
- Suicidal ideation
- Severe depression symptoms
- Active substance dependence
- Trauma surfacing that user can't handle
- Dissociative episodes
- Two+ weeks of worsening despite pillar work

```
What you're describing sounds like it needs more support than this framework can provide.

This isn't a limitation of you—it's a limitation of the approach.
Some things need professional support: a therapist, counselor, or doctor.

Professional help is not defeat. It's a willingness to fight.
Sometimes you need someone to push the wheel with you.

Would you be open to exploring that? I can help you think about what kind of support
might fit, or help you find resources.

The me.md and seed work will still be here when you're ready.
Right now, let's focus on getting you the support you need.
```

---

## me.md Prompts

### me.md Kickoff

**Purpose:** Introduce the me.md and help user start building it
**Use when:** User has worked through chapters (or enough of them) and is ready to compile

```
You've done a lot of work understanding yourself—your patterns, your desires, your foundation, your direction.

Now let's put it all in one place: your me.md.

This is a document that captures who you are. You can paste it into any AI conversation and get responses that actually know you. Instead of generic advice, you get advice grounded in YOUR patterns, YOUR seeds, YOUR foundation.

It has seven sections:
1. Where I Came From — your background and patterns
2. My Foundation — your five pillars right now
3. Where I Am Going — your desires, scripts, seeds, and direction
4. My Relationship with Gain and Loss — what winning and losing taught you
5. What I Need From AI — how you want AI to work with you
6. My Story (optional) — your full narrative if you build one later
7. Revision Log — tracking how the document (and you) evolve

Let's start with whichever section feels most natural. For most people, that's Section 3—your seeds and direction. Which would you like to start with?
```

---

### me.md Section Guide

**Purpose:** Walk user through a specific section
**Use when:** User is building their me.md section by section

#### Section 1: Where I Came From
```
Let's work on Section 1: Where I Came From.

This isn't a resume or the polished version. It's the real one.

Think about:
- Where did you come from? What shaped you?
- What patterns do you recognize running through your life?
- What's your current situation—honestly?

Draw from whatever came up in the early chapters. The parts you usually leave out are often the most useful here.
```

#### Section 2: My Foundation
```
Let's work on Section 2: My Foundation.

For each of the five pillars, describe the current state honestly:

- Sleep: How is it? What helps? What wrecks it?
- Motion: What movement are you getting? What's the barrier?
- Intake: How are you eating? What patterns do you notice?
- Connection: Who's in your life? Is it real contact or just logistics?
- Creation: What are you making? What pulls you?

Then: which pillar drags the others down when it slips? Which one lifts them up?
That's your cascade pattern.

And your financial base—is it enough for the pillars? Is it creating its own problems?
```

#### Section 3: Where I Am Going
```
Let's work on Section 3: Where I Am Going.

Start with what you found in the goal work:
- What's the core desire underneath your surface goals?
- Which inherited scripts did you identify? Which are you keeping?
- Did any goals survive the filter?

Then your seeds—the directions, not destinations:
- One for each pillar: "I am becoming someone who..."
- And for any life domains that matter: work, relationships, learning, etc.

This section draws from Chapter Three (goals), Chapter Five (seeds),
and Chapter Six (pillar seeds). It's the heart of the document.
```

#### Section 4: My Relationship with Gain and Loss
```
Let's work on Section 4: My Relationship with Gain and Loss.

Think about your biggest wins and losses:
- What did your gains actually give you vs. what you expected?
- What did loss teach you that success couldn't?
- How do you typically respond to winning? To losing?
- What patterns do you notice?

If you did a Post-Achievement Audit, that material goes here.
```

#### Section 5: What I Need From AI
```
Let's work on Section 5: What I Need From AI.

This might be the most practically useful section. Think about:

- What communication style works for you? (Direct? Gentle? Short? Detailed?)
- What should AI push back on? (Old scripts, validation-seeking, etc.)
- What should AI absolutely NOT do? (Cheerleading, sugarcoating, etc.)
- Where do you want help? Where don't you?

Be specific. "Don't be overly positive" is okay. "When I'm catastrophizing, call it out directly instead of validating the spiral" is better.

Also worth including: any decision-making principles you rely on. These give AI context for how you think.
```

#### Section 6: My Story (Optional)
```
Section 6 is for your Kishōtenketsu narrative, if you choose to build one.

This is optional. Your me.md is complete without it.
If you're interested, we can work through Chapter 8's story construction process.

The story adds the feeling behind the facts—the arc that connects the dots.
But the document stands on its own with Sections 1 through 5 plus the revision log.
```

#### Section 7: Revision Log
```
Let's set up Section 7: Your Revision Log.

This is simple but important. Every time you update the document, note:
- The date
- What you changed
- Why

Example:
"March 2027 — Updated Section 3. Old seed about career no longer resonates.
Replaced with one that reflects where I actually am."

"June 2027 — Rewrote Section 1 after processing shutting down the company.
Different patterns visible now."

The log becomes a record of your evolution.
Most people won't maintain the document. That's okay—even a single honest version
is more self-knowledge than most people ever organize. But if you do maintain it,
the revision log is where your growth becomes visible over time.
```

---

### me.md Review

**Purpose:** Review a completed me.md for completeness and honesty
**Use when:** User shares their completed document

```
I've read your me.md. Let me give you some observations:

[Note what feels honest and specific]
[Flag any sections that feel generic or performative]
[Identify gaps—sections that are thin or missing]
[Check if seeds are truly directional (not goals in disguise)]
[Note if Section 5 is specific enough to actually shape AI interactions]

A few questions:
- [Question about something that seems contradictory or unclear]
- [Question about a gap you noticed]
- [Invitation to go deeper on a thin section]

Remember: the measure of quality is honesty, not polish.
The document that makes you cringe a little is the one that will actually be useful.
```

---

### me.md Check-In

**Purpose:** Periodic review of me.md for currency
**Frequency:** Every few months or after significant life events

```
Let's check in on your me.md.

When did you last update it? Has anything shifted since then?

Some things to consider:
- Do your seeds still resonate? Or has one gone stale?
- Has your foundation changed? (Pillar that improved, one that slipped?)
- Any new patterns you've noticed about yourself?
- Has your relationship with gain and loss shifted?
- Does Section 5 still reflect how you want AI to work with you?

If something feels off, let's update it. The revision log is there for a reason—
the changes themselves tell a story about your evolution.

One practical note: if your me.md has grown, consider whether you're sharing
all of it every time. Use the sections relevant to each conversation.
Too much context can actually make AI responses worse.
```
