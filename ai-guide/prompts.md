## Effortless Goals

```
I want you to walk me through a goal-filtering method called Effortless Goals. It has 5 steps. Guide me through them one at a time — don't rush ahead. Ask me each question and wait for my response before moving on.

Here's the method:

**Step 1: Surface Goal**
Ask me to write down what I think I want. Unedited, as I'd say it at a party.

**Step 2: Radical Self-Honesty**
Help me drill into WHY I want this. Keep asking "and why is that important?" until I reach something uncomfortable or vulnerable. The honest answer almost always lands in one of four core desires:
- Security (safety, stability, freedom from fear)
- Acceptance (belonging, being valued, mattering, love)
- Autonomy (control, freedom, self-determination)
- Competence (feeling capable, respected for skills, being "enough")

Be patient. If my answer feels safe or surface-level, gently probe deeper. This step is hard.

**Step 3: Create Aligned Goal**
Once we've found the core desire, help me translate it into a concrete, actionable goal that actually serves that desire. It should be specific enough to estimate duration, have clear completion criteria, and have an identifiable strategy.

**Step 4: Minimize**
Help me find the smallest version of this goal that still satisfies the core desire. The discipline is making it smaller. It must be achievable with ONE strategy — if it needs multiple strategies, it's a vision, not a goal.

**Step 5: Reality Multiplier**
Ask me to estimate total hours needed (hours/week × duration). Then multiply by 10. This isn't pessimism — research shows we underestimate effort by roughly 10x (Kahneman's Planning Fallacy: 91.5% of major projects go over budget/schedule). Ask: "At 10x the effort, do you still want this?"

**What happens after:**
- If the goal survives all 5 steps: "Happy Hunting" — proceed with clear eyes. Ramp up slowly; sustainable effort beats heroic sprints.
- If 10x kills motivation, check: Is the desire not strong enough? (return to Step 2) Is time commitment too low? (adjust hours) Did I not minimize properly? (return to Step 4)
- If the goal just stops making sense entirely — if drilling to "I want to feel like I matter" makes the original goal look ridiculous — that's called the Trap Door. It means goals themselves may not be the answer. In that case, suggest I try planting a "seed" instead: a directional statement like "I am becoming someone who [direction, not destination]." Seeds can't fail the way goals can. They express aspiration (wanting to DO) rather than craving (wanting to GET).

Start with Step 1 now.
```

## Seed Planting

```
I want you to help me create what are called "narrative seeds" — directional statements about who I'm becoming, not goals to achieve.

Background: Most goals are fragile (you succeed or fail) and often don't satisfy even when achieved. Seeds are different. The formula is: "I am becoming someone who [direction, not destination]." They express aspiration — wanting to DO rather than wanting to GET. Each aligned action is complete in itself. There's no finish line.

Guide me through this process:

1. **Start with domains.** Ask me to complete "I am becoming someone who..." for these areas (only the ones that feel relevant):
   - Body/health
   - Relationships
   - Work/craft
   - Community/contribution
   - Any other domain that matters to me

2. **Check each seed:**
   - Is it directional (not a disguised goal)? "...who runs a marathon" is a goal. "...who moves through the world rather than hiding from it" is a seed.
   - Does it come from me, or from a script someone else wrote (parents, culture, social media)?
   - Does saying it feel like relief or obligation? Obligation = possibly inherited, worth examining.
   - Is it about doing or about getting somewhere?

3. **Refine.** Help me adjust any that sound like goals in disguise or inherited scripts. Seeds should feel true to what I actually want, not what I think I should want.

4. **Start small.** I only need one or two to begin with. I don't need a seed for everything.

If I'm coming from a failed goal, help me extract the underlying desire (usually security, acceptance, autonomy, or competence) and translate it into a direction.

Start by asking me what areas of life feel most important right now.

## Pillar Assessment & Stabilization

```
I want you to help me assess and stabilize my life foundation using a framework called the Five Pillars. These are: Sleep, Motion, Intake (food + mental), Connection, and Creation.

The idea: these five areas feed each other like a flywheel. Better sleep creates clarity to move. Movement calms the mind enough for better food choices. Better food supports deeper sleep. Connection creates belonging. Creation gives purpose. One pillar improving slightly creates space for the next.

It also works in reverse: bad sleep wrecks willpower, which wrecks eating, which wrecks sleep further, which kills motivation to move, which leads to isolation, which leads to weeks lost in a spiral.

**Step 1: Assess each pillar.** Ask me to honestly describe the current state of:
1. Sleep — consistent? disrupted? how many bad nights per week?
2. Motion — any physical movement? even walking? what's the barrier?
3. Intake — eating patterns? mostly whole foods or processed? what about mental intake (doom-scrolling, etc.)?
4. Connection — meaningful human contact? or logistics-only? isolated?
5. Creation — making anything? work with intention? or going through motions?

**Step 2: Identify the cascade.** Help me see which pillar drags others down when it slips, and which one pulls them up when it improves.

**Step 3: Find the entry point.** Ask me: "Which pillar feels LEAST impossible to improve slightly right now?" Not which is most broken — which has the lowest barrier. Usually it's walking (not exercise — walking. 10 minutes, out the door, no destination).

**Step 4: Minimal intervention.** Help me define the smallest possible improvement for that one pillar. Examples:
- Walking: 10 minutes tomorrow, no destination, screen in pocket
- Sleep: bedtime 30 minutes earlier for one week
- Intake: one meal tomorrow slightly cleaner
- Connection: one genuine conversation this week (therapist counts)
- Creation: one small thing made or done for someone

**Step 5: Flywheel frame.** Explain how this one small change feeds the others. Set expectation: it'll be slow at first (pushing a heavy wheel uphill), then it turns on its own, then it pulls you. Expect to lose it sometimes — the restart gets easier each time.

If multiple pillars are severely compromised (no sleep, no movement, no connection, substance dependence), suggest professional help first. That's not defeat — it's a willingness to fight. Sometimes you need someone to push the wheel with you.

Start with the assessment now.

## Post-Achievement Audit

```
I recently achieved something and I want to do a structured reflection on it before I move on. This is called a Post-Achievement Audit.

Background: Research shows that after success, the brain closes the book. It stops examining what happened, credits skill over luck, misses what almost went wrong, and learns the wrong lessons. Managers who felt successful in past acquisitions actually performed worse in subsequent ones (Zollo's "superstitious learning"). The audit is designed to counter this.

Walk me through these questions one at a time. Wait for my response to each before moving on.

**0. Separation**
Remind me: "This achievement is something you did, not who you are." (Identity fused with outcomes leads to bigger crashes when loss comes — Crocker's contingent self-worth research.)

**1. Expected Feeling**
"What did you expect to feel when you achieved this?" Be specific — security from the promotion? satisfaction from the purchase? peace from the milestone?

**2. Actual Feeling**
"What did you actually feel? How does it compare to what you expected? How long before it faded back to baseline?"

**3. Cost Assessment**
"What did this cost you?" Consider: time, energy, relationships, opportunities foregone.

**4. Exposure Created**
"What do you now have to maintain, protect, or live up to? What can you now lose that you couldn't before?"

**5. Near Misses** (Research by Ellis shows this is the most valuable question)
"What almost went wrong? What did you get away with?"

After all five, help me summarize what I actually learned — not the story I'd tell at a party, but the real lessons. This material is useful for understanding my patterns around achievement.

Start with step 0 now.

## me.md Builder

```
I want you to help me build a document called "me.md" — a comprehensive self-profile that captures who I am. The purpose: I can paste this (or relevant sections) into any AI conversation and get responses grounded in MY patterns, MY direction, and MY preferences — instead of generic advice.

The document has 7 sections:

1. **Where I Came From** — Background, formative experiences, patterns I recognize, current situation. Not a resume. The real version.

2. **My Foundation** — Current state of five life pillars: Sleep, Motion, Intake (food + mental), Connection, Creation. Which ones drag the others down, which pull them up (cascade patterns). Financial base: enough? overshooting?

3. **Where I Am Going** — Core desires underneath my surface goals. Inherited scripts I've identified (kept or discarded). Goals that survived filtering, if any. My directional seeds: "I am becoming someone who..." for each area that matters. This is the most important section — without direction, it's just a profile.

4. **My Relationship with Gain and Loss** — What my wins actually gave me vs. what I expected. What loss taught me. How I typically respond to winning and losing. Patterns in my relationship with achievement.

5. **What I Need From AI** — Communication style preferences. What to push back on. What NOT to do. Where I want help. Decision-making principles. Be specific: "When I'm catastrophizing, call it out directly" is better than "don't be too positive."

6. **My Story (optional)** — A narrative arc if I choose to build one. The document is complete without this.

7. **Revision Log** — Date, what changed, why. The changes over time tell their own story.

Guide me through this section by section. Some guidelines:
- Start with whichever section feels most natural (usually Section 3 — seeds/direction)
- Honest and rough is better than polished and performative
- Leave sections blank if I'm not ready — gaps are better than filler
- Don't try to do it all at once

Before we start: a privacy note. If I'm using a cloud AI, my conversation is stored on their servers and may be used for training. I should check: Does this provider store conversations? Can I delete them? Are they used for training? Local AI (running on my own machine) is an alternative where nothing leaves my computer.

Also: when I use this document later, I shouldn't always paste the whole thing. Sharing only the relevant sections gives better results than flooding the conversation with everything.

Ask me which section I'd like to start with.
```

## Seed & Direction Check-In

```
I want to do a periodic check-in on my life direction. I use directional statements called "seeds" — each one follows the format "I am becoming someone who [direction, not destination]."

My current seeds are:
[PASTE YOUR SEEDS HERE]

Help me reflect on each one by asking:
1. Over the past [period], what actions aligned with this direction?
2. What didn't align? What got in the way?
3. Does this seed still resonate? Or has it gone stale?
4. Has anything shifted in how I see this direction?

If a seed needs replacing, that's growth, not failure. Help me plant a new one if needed.

After we've reviewed all seeds, help me note any changes for my revision log (date + what changed + why).

Also check: am I actually reflecting here, or am I ruminating? Reflection feels like curiosity and forward movement. Rumination feels hot, stuck, cycling the same thoughts. If it's rumination, tell me to stop thinking and go for a walk instead.

## Story Construction (Optional)

```
I want to build a personal narrative using a structure called Kishōtenketsu — a four-part East Asian narrative form that doesn't require conflict as the organizing principle.

The four parts:
- **Ki (Introduction):** Establishes context and tone. My world, however it was.
- **Shō (Development):** Life unfolding. The texture of experience before the shift.
- **Ten (The Twist):** A perspective shift that recontextualizes everything. Not a crisis — an insight. The heart of the structure.
- **Ketsu (Reconciliation):** Where my direction points. Open-ended. Life continues.

Important: We build it BACKWARDS (because you can't write your past properly until you know what it's leading to — narratives filter memory).

Walk me through these steps one at a time:

**Step 1: Dump** — Ask me to write my story as I currently tell it to myself. Raw, unedited, the dominant narrative. It might be darker or more scattered than expected. That's fine — I need to see what I've been working with.

**Step 2: Seeds** — I should already have directional "I am becoming someone who..." statements. Ask me to share them. If I don't have them, help me create some first (for health, relationships, work, and any other domains that matter).

**Step 3: Ten (the twist)** — Ask me to write about: What's been happening recently that brought me here? Crises, realizations, things shifting? What am I doing to stabilize? And this moment — doing this work — is part of the shift.

**Step 4: Ketsu** — Ask me: Where do your seeds point? Not what you'll achieve — who you're becoming. What does life look like living aligned with those directions? Keep it open-ended.

**Step 5: Reconstruct Ki & Shō** — Now go back to my dump with fresh eyes. Help me find "unique outcomes" — moments that contradict the dominant story. Times I wasn't anxious, did follow through, the pattern broke. Connect them across time to surface an alternative narrative. Ask me to name that pattern.

**Synthesis** — Help me weave all of this into a coherent Kishōtenketsu narrative. Draft something from my materials for me to edit. It should feel like MY story.

Safety notes:
- If the dump surfaces difficult material and I feel overwhelmed, we pause.
- Don't force redemption before I've processed difficulty (that creates shame spirals).
- If I'm cycling the same thoughts without new insights, that's rumination — tell me to stop and go walk.

Start with Step 1.
```

## Framework Explanation

```
I'm going to describe a life-direction framework. Read it and then ask me how you can help.

The framework comes from "The Artificial Guide to a Great Human Life." Core premise:

Most goals are fragile — you succeed or fail, and even success often doesn't satisfy (arrival fallacy, dopamine mediates wanting not liking). We chase inherited scripts from parents, culture, and social media without realizing it. We underestimate effort by roughly 10x (planning fallacy). And we fuse identity with outcomes, which means gain is addictive and loss is devastating.

The alternative:
1. **Filter goals** using Effortless Goals (5-step method: surface goal → radical self-honesty to find core desire → create aligned goal → minimize → multiply timeline by 10)
2. **Plant seeds** — directional statements ("I am becoming someone who...") that express aspiration rather than craving. Seeds can't fail the way goals can.
3. **Build a foundation** — Five Pillars (sleep, motion, intake, connection, creation) that feed each other like a flywheel
4. **Compile a me.md** — a 7-section self-profile that gives any AI full context to actually help you: background, foundation, direction/seeds, relationship with gain/loss, AI preferences, optional story, revision log
5. **Optionally**, weave seeds into a Kishōtenketsu narrative for those who want the depth of story

The me.md is the main deliverable. Seeds are the mechanism. The story is optional depth.

Professional help (therapist, coach, doctor) is valid at any stage — not defeat, but willingness to fight.

How can you help me with any part of this?
